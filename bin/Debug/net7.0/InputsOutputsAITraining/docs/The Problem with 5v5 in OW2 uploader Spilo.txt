 I like 5v5, but it's the only downside to 5v5. Is that game-based? I'm just going to feel more volatile and there's nothing that you can do about it. I don't think enough people understand why things feel so much more tenuous and overwatched, like there's so much more stumps, either direction, is because when you make things 5v5, there have one person's bad day, or one person's good day has so much more of an impact. So, over the course of a thousand games, the win-loss is not going to be impacted, but there are going to be a lot more volatile games and either direction. And if you're not aware of that, then you're going to contribute to the problem because you're going to be one of those volatile people, tilted off of the curb stomping, the previous game, and you're going to make the next game a curb stomping because you're right, and you're the irony right there. So, I think let's put it this way. If there was a thousand versus a thousand, we're talking about a massive multi-online role playing game, PvP, Overwatch 2 fight. As assuming that everything was the same, and there wasn't like some massive compositional gap or massive terrain gap, things would feel fairly close. So, this would be hard to like notice at least early on, one person's bad game wouldn't really notice. But if it's a one B1, you could see from the wrong side of the bed and you're cooked. This one shot in your cooked, and then you expand that to 5v5. And 5v5 is a significant reduction from 6v6, a significant reduction, and it's also a significant reduction in the tank roll, which was kind of the more vanilla slow, paste control role. So, you're going to notice more stops, you talk about the quality of the game, you have to understand that it doesn't matter if the matchmaking was perfect. The quality of 5v5 is going to be more tenuous, and it's the I like 5v5, but it's the only downside to 5v5. 100% going to feel more volatile, and it's nothing that you can do about it. That is funny because I've literally been arguing with people in discolds over the swip people on the matchmaker. So it's like the matchmaker sucks. And the reason the game is feel crazy is because all it takes is one person to have something going on, and then it's going to be one side of it, and it's just kind of going to be stoic about that. Yeah, 100% and the impact is going to be more than 6v6, that's just how it is. Absolutely. So for you, it's just going into every game and thinking, okay, I know it might be going either way, and I'm not going to say here, pretend that it's more fun to have competitive games, of course. But also go into it with a mindset, like I'm just going to enjoy playing the role and performing at my best regardless of what happens. Because it doesn't matter if you lose every single fight, you can still hit some shots. You can still pop off, you can still be thinking about my positioning in my off-angling. And you know what? Beating up on people is occasionally fun too, and a guilty pleasure sort of way. So you're going to be benefiting from it just as much as that you're getting victimized by it as well. So go on to what is good about mine since you possibly can and just let it go.
