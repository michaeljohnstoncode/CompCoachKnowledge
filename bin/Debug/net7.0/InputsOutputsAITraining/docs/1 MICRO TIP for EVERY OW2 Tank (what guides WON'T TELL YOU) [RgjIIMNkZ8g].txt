 If you don't know of and or aren't using these tips, you're literally a troller. These tips are incredibly important to play tank more effectively in Overwatch 2. Let's not waste any time. You can combo power block and cover usage to bait important cooldowns. Obviously this means that you won't get your power punch, but oftentimes I find it worth it. Stay near a wall, press E, cancel it by pressing your power block again to bait the cooldown and then you've got a free engage. Everyone should know that Divas is a shotgun hero and does essentially no damage at range. However, a lot of people make the mistake of overcompensating and trying to force to get all up in the enemy's face and then missing most of their shots. Stay close, but it's okay to cancel your boosters at about 2-3 meter range so it's a lot easier to attract both your micro missiles and your damage itself. Juggler Queen Ultimate can be a very in-the-moment decision. Thankfully, the ultimate allows for elastic and adjustments between the pressing of the Q and the actual launching of the rampage. Miniarist is agreed for the 200 HP damage one-shot and missed the opportunity to pull the trigger early. Don't forget that your ultimate does damage on windup and charge as well, and it's better to pull the trigger earlier and finish the kill afterwards if someone's about to escape. Usually it's okay to cycle your cooldowns as a remocker using your shield and your vortex and then transitioning into your nemesis form, sometimes versus targets with high damage or high CC. It's helpful to use either your shield, your E, or both to help you close to this and secure the kill with the nemesis form. Important tip to remember with a Reinhardt is left shoulders suck, right shoulder boot. Just like the hitbox in the animation describes that it's actually leading with the left shoulder, which means that anything closer to the left side of your hitbox is more likely to hit the pin, the right side is more likely to knock it away. Roadhog's ultimate can be used as an animation cancel when combined with hook to put out a lot of damage, especially on tanks. Just be careful to not press your Q too sloppily otherwise you can cancel the hook animation itself. Everybody knows that you can cancel Sigma's primary fire with rock, but did you know you can do the opposite as well? Canceling his rock animation with primary fire immediately afterwards? You can even combine both animation cancels for even more lethal damage. New best burst combo for Winston is the alternate fire into the zaps, into the melee cancel, and into resuming your zaps. If you're not comfortable doing the melee cancel on landing, don't worry about it, it doesn't increase your DPS, it only saves you a little bit of ammo. Two tips for wrecking ball, one is to help your engage give a little extra damage, you can always greed the gun before you slam, there's no need to slam immediately. You can also mess up the timing of certain counter CC abilities used in ball slam. In addition to that, make sure to fully utilize his shields, remember shields regenerate HP after not taking damage for 3 seconds, so you can go in, pay some attention, and let your shields regenerate some of that HP back before you re-engage. Little tip for Zarya, try to avoid the team bubbling immediately when you're taking space when you haven't taken any damage. Instead, try to take some damage first then bubble, it allows your support to heal up your HP underneath the bubbles duration. Some exceptions may apply like when you need to block a very important cooldown early. Hope you enjoyed the video, leave me any questions you have in the comments, and that's it.
