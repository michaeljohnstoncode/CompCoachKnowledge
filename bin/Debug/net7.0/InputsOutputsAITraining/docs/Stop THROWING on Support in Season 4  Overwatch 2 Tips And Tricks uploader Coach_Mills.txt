 I've been coaching a lot of support players recently and support players consistently leave more value on the table than any other role on average. This means less individual impact and more relying on your teammates to get your wins and losses, which is definitely not the way to climb. So let's break down why you're not very good at support right now and how we can get you good at support as quickly as possible. And I'm going to need you to Zen Kick that subscribe button and let's get started. Now the most common problem with support players is that they have heel bot syndrome. Especially coming from Overwatch 1 or maybe it's just the general presumption of the term quote unquote healer people heal a lot on support. They heal way too much in fact. And the thing that you need to understand is that the vast majority of the impact that you get from a support doesn't even have anything to do with your healing at all. Most supports have some crazy utility that you can use in a game. They have things like Nate, Susu, Speed, Boost Discord. All of these abilities have such a high impact over the battle. And you also have some really high damage numbers as well on a no-range falloff with really high burst damage. You even have characters like Zen that can just straight up one if you want the majority of the DPS category and all of these characters have the means to have more impactful plays with their abilities on average. Really really high damage that isn't quite up to par but comparable and the option to heal when you need to, which is another tool in the your otherwise suite of tools that supports have at their disposal. You got to understand that with all of these pieces of value there is diminishing returns. While yes, healing up a whole bunch of people that are in critical condition and would survive and be enabled by you healing them is fantastic. Overhealing them at the cost of your other impactful things that you can be doing is just not worth it. The best way to explain it is like you have a 95 in math and you spend all your time at effort bringing that 95 up to a 99 and you're failing all your other classes. That makes no sense right? And I know what you're going to say. Hey, my teammates really really need my heels or they're just going to die or if I don't heal my team they're just going to flame me nonstop if I don't heal them nonstop. And the first thing that you need to understand is that one it oftentimes becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where you heal your teammates too much and they will start to play around that expected amount of healing. And sometimes you just got to let someone learn their lesson. Like you just got to be okay with if there's a play in front of you something you want to go for. Maybe a teammate that is too over eager to aggressive not playing cover will die because you're not permarkocketing them and that's just not your responsibility to protect them positionally. The second thing is every single player that you're going to run into is going to want you to pocket them. They're going to want all your resources all your time, all your effort. But the reality of it is that is not really in your best interest if you want to climb. They want everything from you. They want you to not depest it all. They want you to not go for impactful abilities. Only use it on them. A tank player wants you to permarkock at them and soothe you only them or not only them. But you are way more likely to lose this way. And just because that's what they want, doesn't mean that's what will get you the win. And I know it can be frustrating when you're always at the butt end of getting flamed or roasted because you're trying to play in a way that's going to win you the game when it's not what you teammates want. But that player is going to flame you in whatever rank that is and they're going to stay there and you're going to rank up. So don't worry about it too much. Now the second reason you're not getting a lot of value on support is that you're just dying far too much. You got to understand that your life is your most valuable resource and I find that especially when I'm watching and coaching different support players when a fight gets chaotic and their team needs healing and there's so much stuff that needs to be done they oftentimes forgo their own life to fulfill their objective. It's almost like they would rather die trying to do their quote unquote job than live and let people around them down or maybe get flamed. And the thing you got to understand is you can only do what is possible for you. At a lot of times your teams are all dying you're getting jumped and the only way that you can actually win a fight like that is if you first are alive. Maybe your teammates are going to die. Maybe someone that's that up position is going to die and it's not your job to save everyone. It's more important to prioritize your own life and your own positioning that it is to prioritize the lives of anyone around you because most of the time you're going to maybe get off a little bit of healing here and there and die and yeah like I said you're not going to get flamed but you could have turned the fight. If you would have played in a safe position, maybe focused all your resources on keeping just one person alive, played around your cooldowns. You're very, very impactful ones and because your alive your value is technically infinite and the ability for you to turn an entire teamfight is incredibly high. So don't ever make the mistake of trying to put your job or jobs above just valuing your own life. It's the most important resource that you just don't get back. Now the next big reason why you're not getting the value on support that other people are and it's because you're overwhelmed under pressure and support is a role that I think can be very, very difficult to play the best. That doesn't mean that it's difficult for you to get value. It means that it's difficult for you to make the correct decision at all times because there's so many between deciding to heal, deciding who to heal, deciding if you should be damaging, deciding if you should be using abilities defensively or offensively, there's so many different decisions that you have at all times and I find that the more support players I coach, the more that I see is that they often get overwhelmed under pressure and they just decide on any decision instead of trying to slow down and pick the right one. I understand when players are low, when people are dying, when you're getting jump done, whatever the case may be, it's your first inclination to just start dumping cool downs and just doing every option available to you. It doesn't matter if it's correct, it just matters that you're just dumping out everything you possibly can because you're under too much pressure, but you gotta learn to be calm and collected under that pressure and realize a couple of things. One, it's more important to do things correctly than it is to do things fast and it's better for you to develop as a player to focus on connection with a play than it is for speed of a play. This is a very common thing I say where honours will see any amount of pressure and they'll just throw it a sleep dart right away when they weren't really under that much threat yet, but they forced out that sleep because they were under potential pressure and there was going to be a future opportunity for them to hit a sleep dart a lot easier, but they would rather just get the decision over with as soon as possible. And while I did talk about how your life is the most valuable resource in the previous tip, realize that your health bar is also just a resource. At the end of the day, let's say you're drooling a genji. It doesn't really matter whether or not you sleep that genji when you're full health or your 30% health. If at the end of the day, all that matters is that you connect with your abilities you connect with your play or you make the decision correct instead of fast, we can work on that speed later and I'm not going to say that there aren't some situations where going faster does matter, but most of the time you have a lot more time to work with a lot more health to work with and if you just slow down, calm yourself and focus more on connection that speed, I promise you more of your plays are going to go better and you're going to be able to make better decisions under pressure and you can ramp up your speed once your connection is closer to 100%. Now the fourth big reason why you are just leaving a ton of value of a support on the table and it's your ability management. The thing that you need to understand is that there's a couple of big mistakes that people are making with abilities. Number one is using your abilities in the pre-fight. You're throwing out ability, you're wasting out ability, this could be an amp up, this could be a suzu, this could be anything, you're wasting out ability before the fight is started, but right when it's about to start so that if something happens you don't have your ability to pivot on an aggressive play or utilize it in a very proactive way. On top of that you gotta understand that your ability use oftentimes should change relative to the enemy composition and relative to your situation or the enemy's ultimate. So as an example let's say we're back on that on a train and the enemy team is rocking like a sigma, a freaking bastion, a freaking bap, all these characters right? So what you should be doing oftentimes is looking for situations where you can try to get offensive, made value look for a lob above the shield look for a lob around the corner. Some way to force a lot of cooldowns because a really strong need could bait out a ton of cooldowns from sigma, could just kill a bastion, could bait out cooldowns from a bap. It could do a lot of good so you're gonna be constantly looking for these offensive nades and making sure to position yourself where you're not gonna need to use nade defensively or even on your team or try it all possible to avoid those things. However, let's say the enemy team is now Winston, Tracer, Sombra all these characters that are gonna look for you and jump on you. It would be in your best interest not to just always throw your nades offensively because if you don't have it in the time frame that you're dove on you need it to deny that play that value. So how you use this is gonna be fundamentally different in one situation or another. Now let's move on to a different example. Let's say you're playing Kyrko and a lot of the time what you should be doing on Kyrko is applying pressure from an off angle, trying to get some amount of cooldowns out maybe even a pick, teleport to your team and then repeat the cycle. But the thing is there is a key window in there where you're not gonna have to teleport, you're not gonna have Susu and you're not as ready to deny certain things from the enemy and that could matter if the enemy team are walking into the fight with Shatter or walking into the fight with maybe a junk queen or in this situation. You have to understand that while that's one predominant playstyle and one predominant way to use your abilities that you think is good for the start of engagement so your most midfights it might not be good in the face of certain ultimate in particular and that means that you might want to change your playstyle relative to that situation. So it's not only about learning when and where you can be greedy with your abilities but when you should not be greedy to counter certain things that are coming up. If you can differentiate those things then masses is literally just a snap away. I'm gonna be honest here. Now last but certainly not least and I find this more with supports than any other role and it's the mechanical mastery and the idea that you don't need mechanics if you're gonna be a support player. Now I think that this oftentimes comes from the fact that most of the time people that are crazy about improving their mechanics and crazy about their aim, crazy about just hitting those dinks and just being really, really mechanically amazing, those players are more drawn to the dps role than any other role. Most of the time and with supports it's interesting because a lot of supports require even more mechanics than the dps roles. On a Zen, BAP all of these characters require really, really amazing mechanics and even the ones that don't traditionally have the most ancient mechanics still have special mechanics that you need to learn and you need to go through the motions to learn. Movement on Lucio, the movement on mercy, understanding, you're timing and the way that you should move on a character like Morira. There's a lot of things that you need to learn and if you don't learn these things then you're not gonna consistently be able to 1v1 and win duels like is possible for the support role. There's a lot of supports that will just straight up win in a 1v1 against a ton of the dps roster but a lot of dps are getting away with it not because the dps are so much better than you it's just because you're not putting in the time to grind and hone those mechanics and this is super super important. So how do you improve them as fast as possible? A couple of things. Vaxda is a great way to do it. Specific game modes dependent on your hero. I think even certain little mini games that you think wouldn't be super super helpful to you are actually fairly helpful on movement tech characters and then just generally practicing your raw aim period in like IO Stucks' aim trainer. As a support don't allow your mechanics to lag behind the rest of your skill set and if your mechanics are really really good I promise you it's gonna allow you to have such a crazy potential impact when you can do impactful thing after impactful thing.
