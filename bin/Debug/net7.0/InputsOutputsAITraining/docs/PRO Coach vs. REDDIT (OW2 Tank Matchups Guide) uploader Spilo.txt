 Hey guys, this is my morning video. Just kind of got up and got some work done. Got some editing done. Check that Overwatch University and there's a cool little post by E.Pull Bailey called the best and worst match of everything and Overwatch. You complete tech matchup guide. I'll link this post in the description. It was a really cool idea. I wanted to actually check out the post live, give my thoughts on it. So I'm just exactly going to be a hammer time, but it's going to be more of, I'm going to use this idea as a springboard to put some of my own ideas as well. It's got a nice, looks like a YouTube video as well. In this video, I'm going to get this guy to check out. I look like some good stuff here, but I want to get my thoughts on this as well. So I'm going to do some opinion is against Winston. Both here's like a back line. Yeah, so actually like the Doomfist versus Winston matchup. Whenever we're looking at tank matches, we have to look at two things. Number one, you have to look at the 1v1 matchup. So exactly how does the hero do in the 1v1 and strictly the 1v1 and then it comes to the play style. So the play style is essentially how does the hero play and compliment the other hero's play style. So the reason why these different variations need to exist, the sort of, the differences between the two need to exist is the classic one is Zarya versus D. So Zarya beats Diva and a 1v1. Strictly, most of the time, like it's pretty straightforward. If there's any sort of healing involved, however, Zarya doesn't always really counter Diva in terms of the play style because of the Bivis playing correctly in terms of using high guns and offing those, usually Zarya is not going to be able to reach her or access her. Her bubbles lose a lot of value versus the Diva which he's playing like that. So it's actually not just simply, oh, it's the 1v1's a lot of times the play style itself. And in a way, I think Doomfist definitely can win the 1v1, but I also think that in a way Doomfist can do pretty good, even just by countering the play style because a lot of what Winston wants to do is he wants to commit with bubble. You can display some with bubble, you can display some before bubble to force his bubble. So I do think that Doomfist is probably best match of his versus Winston. I don't see any other hero here as being a favorable matchup. So I think it's going to be more about displacing the Winston and punching him around as well as he's just got a big fat head that you could shoot in front. And he's the only tank that I think has relatively low damage at close range, at least in relation to the rest of the tank line. Like obviously, wrecking ball a little bit lower damage, but there's a lot harder to punish as Doomfist. You can definitely punch him out of slam, you can punch him out of grapple, which is probably the best thing that you can do. But in a 1v1, Junker Queen's got a better gun than you in close range. Or Riss has got a better gun. Rmai was going to be doing better damage to your face. Rmai was going to swing the new face. Diva is going to blow you up. Roadhog is going to blow you up. Even Stig was going to blow you up. He's got the rock as well. Zarya is going to melt you. Racking ball and Winston are the only two like relatively low DPS heroes. And those are also the heroes that Doomfist Quint's is down on me. It does pretty well versus. And I think Winston's the more fragile of the bunch because he's more more punished by that shotgun stuff, wrecking ball could just go in ball form. So in terms of the worst matchup for Doomfist. So I don't think it's Diva because Diva can take pretty much has a hard time keeping up with Doomfist's tempo, even with low boost. So she's not quite mobile enough to mark her peel Doomfist consistently. Although she can destroy him in the 1v1. Junker Queen can't always reach where Doomfist stages. And the same thing goes for Rmai Trah. Rmai Hart Doomfist can pretty much avoid. Roadhog is a pretty bad matchup but since the damage nerf it's not as bad as it was in the past. Sigma again you can avoid him pretty much. It's really just rock. The chieftal worry about Zarya again. It does okay for bubble peeling and pressure but again though she could be pretty much avoid him. I agree. I think I agree with his assessment here which is the Rissa who's able to stay with her team and protect him from this dive. So I don't think it's so much a staying with her team. So much is that she's just able to put all consistent range pressure on the Doomfist and Javon is such like a death sentence. I will say this. If you guys don't know that the Javon itself does feed Doomblock. So if you hit the Doom with the Javon while he's blocking the damage of the Javon will go to the Doomfist block. So you need to be very careful that you can cancel the block but you could also actually feed the block at the same time even though the stun doesn't cancel the damage that it does. So that's something to kind of keep in mind. Hmm. Yeah, I mean I think Rissa is right now probably the best counter but I think it could make a good argument that if this here for example was stronger that he would probably can still be the best counter just because he wins the 1v1 he can counter the playstyle. He could set up on angles where your Doomfist is trying to stay from. I don't even think it's necessarily that Rissa can play on offing those or play with her team. I actually think it's more along the lines that the just Rissa has better range damage and has a Javon that consistent CC that just makes it really really hard. It's very actually these two heroes are very similar. The only difference for me versus Doomfist is that this hero feels a little stronger more of the time than this hero. So okay let's keep going. Diva as the best matchup is also versus Winston. He was the ultimate peel take match. I mean I wouldn't say trying to dive her back because he was the disruptive put the Winston trouble. I saw the problem with it was. So I actually think it's not so much about the peel here. So, Diva is really quite good at peeling but a lot of Overwatch 2 is more about marking. And marking is essentially as a dive hero tries to flank to set up on your backline. Our tries to walk forward to set up a dive on your backline. You just basically one D1 that you walk in front of them before they even dive and start to shoot them in the face. So, a Diva marking, Winston is a Winston taking a high ground. They give a goes and flies at the high ground and this starts to shoot the Winston face before he even dives. And you just basically can force bubble. You can force some of his HP, you can force an early jump. You can force him to back off. That messes up his dive. Marking is just simply you're trying to take an angle or flank or high ground and I'm just going to sit right in the top of you. You prevent me from doing what you want to do. And Diva is really really good at that because even though Diva is not, let's say very good at one feeling. It's already air. Not very good at one feeling. My try not very good at one feeling. A Sigma, right? Diva is very good at one feeling. I do invest or a Winston or even sometimes to an extent or wrecking boss. So if those heroes can't avoid her and Winston isn't good at avoiding her because her mobility is even lower cooled and his is. Then it's very easy for you to not necessarily peel the Winston because once he's already jumped he's already done what he wants to do. But to before he as he's setting up your already dumping damage in front of his face and if he uses his bubble now he can't jump because any jump without bubbles like me. So I was the working with Boger a couple of weeks ago and he considers Diva is actually to be even more of a Winston counter than Reaper or Bastion for this very same reason because you can always go with a Winstonist and shoot him in the face and shoot him in the face and shoot him in the face and shoot him in the face. And as long as he doesn't have like his in yada or a widow maker in the backline melting you then there's just really nothing that can really stop because he would do so much more damage than he doesn't close range. So again it's not about the peel because if he's already dove yes you can peel and blow up his bubble but it's actually he's already kind of done his job. You want to stop him before he even gets to that point. Okay, worst magic comes from sorry, expressions for simple, sorry is always able to beam through to his matrix. Um, hmm. Hmm. Trying to think here. So obviously the worst one v1 magic is is that. Um. As a as a as a siren goes flying past. Um, I think I think I think it's a fair fair assessment. I think it's just more it's more map dependent than anything else. I think a doom fist can actually be a real a nuisance because he's actually one of the few dive tanks where if can feel really hard to keep up with his tempo he can avoid you. But also I don't think it's a bad matchup at all because if you do get in the one we want he can toast you. Yeah, I think I think if there is a counter for Diva it would be a Zarya. But Diva doesn't feel like she has a lot of counters so much as a lot of situations so she's just not necessarily optimal. She's never feels really bad but she definitely feels very good. Junk and Queen her favorite matchup is also Winston. He's not having a great time in this list of jigger queen. I mean, Winston just has a horrible tank matchup in general, right? Junk and Queen's primary fire is also shotgun mechanic which works super well in terms of the ledge hitbox. And so we're trying to dive the Junk and Queen. She has two counters to prevent this. The first is that team usually play close to her. So she's going to need to try and disrupt the Winston. Secondary community shot is over 50 health. I mean a lot of it for me. It was Winston is just that Junk and Queen has a pretty good mid to close range damage and that if you can match the Winston then you're going to be good to go. I'm trying to think is there anybody that Junk and Queen would prefer to play more into. No, I think that's pretty fair. I think Winston is probably the best but I think the main reason why is he talking about the game. So the main reason why Winston does such so he she does so well versus Winston is this two reasons why. One is for shotgun, right? It's actually not this shout because unfortunately shout if you're playing Junk or Queen. Sometimes you're not going to be stacked on top of your team. So your team might not entirely get the shout. It's the shotgun that like Diva helps you to mark or put a little bit of early pressure on Winston. And it's actually the knife. The knife is a huge one because if you get the knife onto your Winston. If you were soon as mobile breaks if you knife the Winston about one second left and his jump. Okay, that's fun. If the best color to use as he's jumping out you can pull him back. It's very similar to the tech user with the wrecking ball where they slam you knife them. They try to roll away and pull them back in. Same kind of thing as Winston. You kind of cut off as a scapegoat. This is actually a big big thing when teams in Overwatch League when Dr. Hune first came out because we had just come off with a Winston meta with double flux support. So a lot of him still want to play Winston, eight back one of the play Winston. These Asian regions in A regions as well. And you just couldn't make it work because of the knife just as much as the shout. So Junk and Queen very good versus Winston for that for that matter. I think also pretty good versus wrecking ball for that matter. And then terms of the worst matchup for Junk and Queen. What do we say here? Zah, Zah, Zah, Zah, Arissa who is insane survivability at close. Yeah, I think that's fair. I think it's definitely not a favorable matchup. I would actually go as far as say that there's another unfavorable matchup as well. I gave you guys a few seconds to think about it. But if Junk and Queen doesn't do very well up close versus a person. She doesn't do very well and general. And there's another hero he doesn't do very well up close versus and that's also rain hard. So I'd say, Risen, right, her kind of two peas in a pod right here. Risen, you can put out a little bit of shield pressure early, similarly to Arissa where you can shoot her a little bit easier with your knife. It'd be for some cool don's way force javansman, maybe burn some shield. But don't tell me if these two here's a look close to distance, I knew you're just pretty much cooked. Even with carnage, even with knife, if that right hurt has any heal support whatsoever or you've worst case, now if you hit the charge in you, you're just gonna die. You're just gonna die. And generally, Junk and Queen won't be able to break shield fast enough to prevent the rain hard from just walking on top of her. So I had a really hard time when I was playing Junk and Queen in diamond and low masters trying to play around rain hard comps. You almost had to play like a little bit not flinky, but you had to try and find ways to bypass the rain hard shield if you could spam it enough early and often. So Arissa's definitely not a good matchup, but I think right heart deserves a shout as well. Arissa's talking about a matchup, she's definitely best. Your best is definitely it's rain hard. I do not agree with this at all. Arissa's able to connect the rain with almost entirely null fire. No, I disagree here. I think you have a lot of, I think this is a new stomper matchup. If the rain hard isn't very good or isn't able to play cover or doesn't, isn't able to force cool vans, then yeah, you're going to have a hard time. But the thing is that the rain hard is a rain hard gets any heal support and he's able to close the distance within Arissa. After a few swings, you're going to be able to force a fortify, and then the rain hard has the tools to disengage and survive, and then the Arissa can no longer win the matchup without fortify. Arissa takes a really, really, really long time to kill a rain hard, which means that rain hard can generally just force your fortifying win after that. I don't agree with this at all. I think if anything, it's maybe a neutral matchup. I mean, you could jab one the rain hard back, you could jab them, not a pin. You can, you can definitely jab on your shoulder, but these are all like sort of niche things. A good rain hard will never happen to a good rain hard. Yeah, I don't agree with this much at all. I'll say one nice thing is that you can use your, your terror surge, her ultimate through rain hard shield, which is one big, big buff. But I actually think there's a lot of things that'd rather play into as an Arissa rather than rain hard. Junk of Queen is the one that we just talked about, right? I think I'd rather play into a Junk of Queen as a Arissa. I actually think remocturate isn't the worst matchup in the world. I think I'd rather play against a remocturate than it would against a rain hard, especially in some maps. Doomfist depends on the map. If it's a very mobile map, I don't want to play versus Doomfist, but if it's a very narrow map, love playing versus Doomfist. Roadhog is, I eat this guy for lunch. Roadhog might be the best match up period, because I can destroy this guy in one of the one I can javlin every time he tries to take an angle. He doesn't do any damage to me. My fortify null gets him. My javlin's min gets him. And the aim to extend a hero like a Winston or a wrecking ball. I think I'd rather play a Winston or a wrecking ball than I would versus a rain hard. Depending on the map, of course, but if it's a relatively narrow map, not a lot of background, not that bad, but I don't agree with this one at all. And then the worst match up is, sorry, I definitely agree with this one. Sorry, it's pretty much always dependent on a bubble charging high, it's even more energy than a DPS. One way she's able to change the risk by bling her ultimate. But Risa doesn't really have any defense against Risa, it's beam attack. And to me, that's just, whatever considering heroes is about like, how do they do in the 1v1? Well, you just don't have any way of dealing with Risa beam attack. And the irony here is that everybody's obsessed with Diva versus Risa, which is fair. The irony here is that I think Risa's in some ways, even a little bit worse than even the 1v1, because unlike Diva, Risa doesn't have the mobility to avoid, sorry, you often played about the same ranges in similar positions. So how do you, how do you avoid Zarya beam, right? What I found when I was playing a Risa in Zarya is I would generally have to try and force a bubble, play it a distance where she couldn't quite be menic at trying force a bubble out. And if the Zarya was really disciplined and play cover, sometimes they just had to try and avoid her, which again, with a hero without a lot of mobility, is really, really, really hard. The only time obviously Zarya should be scared of a Risa's if she has fortified enough, I don't have bubbles, but I don't like this match of Risa at all. So I agree with that one. I'm not sure if I talk a little about Ramax as much as Maxi's, but I knew this match is a bad match, it's actually Sigma. Since Ramax is two different ways of clawing, seeing him down, seeing this poking phase, he can close this phase. Yeah, so I actually think this one is really interesting. I don't feel that Ramax has a tank that he really hard counters. I think he can do fairly decent versus some tanks, I think he does fairly decent versus Junk of Queen and some situations. But I also think he can do poorly. I do think that there are situations where he can do okay versus Rineheart in some situations. You can whittle him down more with your gun, with his shield a little bit better than a Risa can, and then actually brawl him through shield better than a Risa can. So I like Ramax versus Rineheart, it's okay on some situations. But I agree, I think Ramax isn't the best tank versus tank hero in the game, but if I were to take a tank one, it would be versus Sigma, where I can absorb some of his damage. While in my Omnick form, burn some of his shield maybe for some of his cooldowns down, and as long as he doesn't have rock or even if he does have rock, if I can close the distance and use Nemesis form, I'm going to win that tank trade. And a lot of the ways that Ramax and Sigma operate are in similar circumstances. So I think Ramax doesn't have a lot of great tank trades, but I think Sigma is probably his best, his worst roadhog. It was all about using your two forms of cone precision, Hog really ruins that with hookability. He can hook Rayman position, and Ramax only have a way of threatening Hog hook. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm. I think here. Yeah, I can see roadhog. The roadhog is really weak right now, so in the way it's if I'm playing or matron, I see a roadhog. I'm not scared just because roadhog is weak, but in theory if roadhog was better balanced, which we don't want. But if roadhog was powered, you know, spike was as high as the rest of these other tanks, then yeah, I might be a little bit concerned about that. Uh, worst matchup besides roadhog for me. Hmm, maybe wrecking ball, maybe wrecking ball, you could definitely grapple him out. Uh, you can use your E, your little suction vortex to prevent him from slamming. You can also prevent that from grappling away and slow him down. But I will say that as a mantra, you're a little bit slow, and you don't have consistent range to the rep, and you don't have any real hard CC. So wrecking ball can kind of just play to avoid you, more so than even like a Winston can, and it could be kind of like you're spectating while he's just abusing your backline. Um, now you could do the same to his backline, which is why I don't say it is as much of a counter, but it is something that it doesn't give you flexibility with what you want to do. You really have to just ignore the wrecking ball because you just do no damage to him and try and trade backlines, which in some maps is easier said to done. So yeah, I, I kind of agree with this one, but I think wrecking ball deserves the shot in some situations. Right, next up is Ryan hurt, whose best matchup comes against Zarya. Ryan is a damage kid as well as range. Uh, uh, did did did did did. Uh, yeah, I mean, yeah, I think a lot of it's just that it's a lot like a wire, it doesn't like Zarya. It's like why not Ryan heart doesn't like Zarya. Or why Zarya doesn't like Ryan heart because both want to fight and close ranges ish, but Zarya right heart just beats the crap out of Zarya and close. Um, it's anything that Zarya really wouldn't want to play versus I think Zarya is again a situation where like similar to Ramatra. Um, a Winston on some maps can actually do pretty good versus Zarya because she can force your bubbles at range, but we'll play in a location where you don't do a lot of being damaged. So Zarya is not beaming people. She's not gonna feel very good. If you're only playing Zarya to bubble off your backline stives and aren't really getting a lot of old charge aren't getting a lot of value. Um, then you're gonna have a hard time getting value with Zarya. You need to be trying to find ways to consistently beaming and that's where dive tanks like our friends right here have a really really, really nice time. Can you guys imagine playing Zarya on watchpoint to roll to versus and Winston wrecking ball just going all over the map. Now that's an extreme example, but that kind of gives you my thoughts in this. So here's the direct one v1. Rine heart was very, very favorable, but I think these heroes are also quite good. Uh, do do do do do do do do. Rine heart's best matchup versus Zarya. Okay. Yep. Um, I don't think there's anything else that Rine heart would crush. I do want to mention that jungle queen is a pretty good matchup as well for Rine heart. And depending on the matchup sigma is as well, but again, it's more of a map specific pick. So it's something to keep in mind. Rine's worship matchup is one of Zarya's best. Risa again, I just I just do not agree with this one at all. And I mentioned my reasons earlier. Rine heart's worst matchup for me is probably. Hmm. Again, if we ignore the strength of the hero right now, it might actually be a really good doom this can be really quite difficult. You can counter pin the doom fist, but Rine heart does have a little more mobility than he used to have. So he can deal a little bit with things like Winston and it could deal a little bit with things like wrecking ball in terms of trading backlines and things like that. Um, I don't know, Rine heart doesn't love mobile things. I might actually say Maybe wrecking ball or doom fist because again, those are two tanks that are super super mobile that he cannot help his team versus so yes, the focus I'm trading backline. But that's a little bit easier said than done. You can't exactly go and swing on it doing fist or wrecking ball most of the time. Now you can't pin these targets. So if you get lucky in pin one of these targets, then that's very helpful. You can also do things like pin through through mines as they're casting and break them. You can shatter either of these targets and they become they're very very killable. But I remember back and overwatch, they went we would play versus good doom fist and it felt really tough where we just felt like we couldn't. We could my right heart was just couldn't just watching his team die unless he stood with his backline and if you stay with your backline you're giving up too much space. So I think Riss is definitely not the worst match. I think doom fist maybe is the worst match. Maybe wrecking ball. I will say that when Winston gets primal that's pretty tough as well because you can't help a lot with that. But definitely more maps of civics. That's a tough thing. Guys, a lot of these just feel really meta and maps specific. Whereas like roadhogs is trash right now. But roadhogs even cooler close to being strong than doom fist hates it, right? Right heart's pretty dull in the strong right now. But let's say Ramatra was super super overtunous before then there'd be no reason to pick right heart and win just pick Ramatra. But Ramatra is still pretty good versus Ramatra and the one being one. So it's like it's a lot of factors. So a lot of this is just opinion and just the way of looking at it. Not necessarily fact it all. Roadhogs, roadhogs, ultimate counter is absolutely best mashup is Winston completely stopped Winston dives. I don't know. I like if I'm playing roadhog, I still think like something like a like a doom fist would be a little bit easier for me. Just because of how easy that hook is without bubble. Although I will say your ultimate does really good versus Winston. I mean, you just cancel everything that he does and she's just, she beats your playstyle. She beats you in the 1v1. It is just nothing you can do. Sigma, Sigma's best matchup is roadhog. I would agree with that as well. You both kind of playing it medium to long range. Kind of like the Zaryah versus Arissa again. But, you know, you know, you're not going to have to do that. Sigma's best matchup is roadhog. I would agree with that as well. You both kind of playing it medium to long range. Kind of like the Zaryah versus Arissa again. But this guy beats this guy because this guy has shields and easy to hit shots and his shift and his rock deals with you well. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think anything that would beat roadhog harder or anything that's singular rather would prefer to play versus I'm getting my mistakes. I'm getting my stuff confused here. No, I think I think that's fair. I think that's fair. War smash up for Sigma is a mantra. That's fair. We talked about that matchup already. Winston. Best matchup is Sigma. I would agree with that again more maps specific, but I think the fact that Winston can beat Sigma in a 1v1 sometimes is like huge. He's like the only thing that you could beat in a 1v1. I think in terms of playstyle, I think Winston does fairly well versus Zaryah by being able to avoid her and force both of her bubbles within playing the way to where she can't reach. Winston versus a Rineheart. The Rineheart can't exactly reach, but he does at least have 10. So that's something that can help out a lot. So I think Winston versus Zaryah, Winston versus Sigma are pretty good matchups. Most of the time, worst matchup is roadhog. We talked about that a little bit already. Ranking ball. Best matchup is against Rineheart. I mean, again, I think probably Ranking ball is going to be doing better probably a little better versus a mantra, but I think either one of these targets is fairly decent. Just because again, you can kind of avoid them entirely because they're not the most mobile. And, you know, I actually think that you're not even that bad versus Zaryah because you can definitely use her bubbles to peel you off. But again, it's easy to avoid her. She will peel off you peel you off, but she actually just surprisingly low damage to you with your armor and your damage reduction unless you super high charge. Okay, worst matchup is roadhog. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, I agree with that. It's definitely not a favorable matchup compared to a lot of the other tanks. I can about can kind of avoid most of the tank cast, but roadhog is a little bit more difficult. Zaryah, as long as matchup comes against Diva, I actually think your strong smash up goes against Arissa. I think there's lots of ways for Diva to play to avoid Zaryah entirely to negate the 1v1 matchup. I think as an Arissa, it's a lot harder to play into a Zaryah than it is for Diva. And then worst matchup comes against Rineheart. Yes. Yes, no. Zaryah and Winston. I think it's right hurt or Winston. I would say that or the worst matchups depending on the situation depending on the map. Zaryah has the best tank matchups overall. Fair enough, I think this is a lot more contextual. But yeah, great, great, great video. Obviously, like I said, a lot of this is going to be contextual on meta and stuff. But I was just interested in commenting on something to figure out how to get my 2 cents.
