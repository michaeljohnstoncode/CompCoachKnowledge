 The best map for every robot Shiro, lets get into it. Diva. Her best map is likely the water in my opinion, because of how flexible Diva is as a hero, she's honestly good on most maps, but her best maps are ones with as tons of angles and high ground, giving her boosters and defense made tricks more value. Her worst map has to be Lee-Jang control center, unless the enemy Seema running pharmacy ash, you're basically trolling picking Diva on that specific map for Lee-Jang. It's way too enclosed and sure, sightline for her, meaning she gets rolled by heroes a divine heart and zarya on that map. Doomfist. His best map I think is Nepal's sanctum on Nepal Shrine. My reasoning is, is that as relatively short sightlines, and the maps have decent amount of cover, allowing them to get value of his slams, whilst also having flanks for Doomfist to approach from and utilise. They're not too linear as my points. His worst map has to be Havana. Junkertown and Sokorei Al are also good picks, all for the reason that they're just too long sightline, meaning he takes a thousand damage before we can even do anything. Junker Queen. Super powerful as of the release of this video, but I think Queen's best map is Coliseo. It's not too short sightline, that heroes like Rhinahot will just run her over, but it's not too long sightline, that heroes like Woodo will just dominate. It's also pretty linear, meaning it's hard to take angles onto her. Her worst map is I think probably Watchpoint of Walter. Her lack of mobility, both horizontal and vertical, makes it really hard to even clear high grounds, and something like a Winston would be much more fitting. A reason. I think likewise, Junker Queen, her best map is Coliseo. The ability of Walsh for her to land her javolin, whilst also not being susceptible to angles too much. What's map is probably Junkertown? I could not tell you what a Vita's gonna do on this map. The sightline is too long for her to land the javolin, or to even get up close and rule, especially if you're up against the Sigma. Remotor. A slight from Junker Queen, he's probably the best pokeball tank in the game, so it's hard to choose a map that he's best at. I certainly think any of the legion maps are up there, as well as Antarctic Peninsula, Kings Rowe, Midtown, Bersand Macabees, Coliseo, etc. However, his worst map really comes down to abusing his lack of mobility. On Jubalta, I think he can struggle quite a bit, and even Hollywood if you're excluding first points. Rinehots. Lee Junker Trorsenter has to be as bread and butter. Super close range, and he's so good on that map that no matter the meta were in, Rinehot will still always see playtime on that map in the Overwatch League. Whilst map is likely watch point Jubalta again. The lack of vertical mobility really hurts him here, and on second point attack, you're really going to struggle with your playing Rinehots. Rowe log. Best map, none, worst map, all of them, don't play this hero until season 7, and this may be if you want Ilioswell. Sigma. Best maps here are going to be a contest between Havana, Junker Town, and Sucker Royale. I'd ever so slightly lean towards Sucker Royale, because at least on Havana, I could see something like a Rinehots spawn camp strategy working, Shambali is also an underrated chowts. This map, I'm leaning towards Lee Jung, because any dive will ball tank work pretty well on any Lee Junk map, and I cannot tell you the last time I saw Sigma being played on any Lee Junk map ever. Winston, because of how bad the other tanks are on this map, watch point Jubalta kinda has to be Winston's pick. Very traditional dive map, plenty of cover to retreat to and get your cauldron's back, and not too long stuck in my diver. Nimbani is also a good chow here too, though third point Nimbani is definitely his worst parts. Speaking of long sightlines and a lack of cover, Junker Town is what I think to be Winston's worst map. I challenge anyone watching this video to play Winston on Junker Town first point attack and cap first points, because unless your sniper's carry, you're really not going to be doing shit on the map. Recking ball. New Queen Street is what I think to be boss best map here, plends your flanks of rotations for you to make, and gets some more food from behind, what's also not being very long sightlines. What's map I think has to be Sucker Royale or Junker Town. Like a water piece of map geometry are you grappling off of on these maps, like it's not going to happen. Also, not too many flankers either, especially on Sucker Royale. Ziya. Ziya is a weird one, because she likes close to medium range, but doesn't want to get rolled over by a vine hater of a marcher. She also doesn't like high gun much. All of all, I'd say King Ziya is a pretty strong map for her, only really struggling on third points. Percent, macabees, midtown, and a wacers gardens are good shots for her too. As for her worst maps, I'm really not a fan of Ziya on the Bonnie, until it's the point, and she's pretty bad on Periso too. Ash. As soon as I typed Ash into my scripts, Luke 66 immediately came into my mind. Medium range sightlines, plends your high ground and angles for you to land those juicy dynamites, and Vialto, Periso, Dvaro, and their Los Lighthouse are good shots too. Worst map I'd say is Sucker Royale. The issue isn't that Ash's bad on this map, it's just that a widow is the much better pick here, and honestly, it was tough choosing a map for Ash, so let me know your thoughts down below. Bastion. Best maps Bastion are super linear ones that have short to medium sightlines. As a result, I'll lead Jeng as up there, and I'll pull Shrine and the poor villager up there too, as well as Percent and Macabees. However, as soon as we open up the map, and there's some long sightlines and big flanks to take, Bastion really focused on the value. New Queen Street, Elios Ruins, Junketown, and Sucker Royale are pretty rough with the sky. Cassidy. This honestly almost all of them. Cassidy is just such an all-round hero, that it's tough saying that King's Roe is better than Blizzard World for example, when they're both pretty good maps of him. Worst map I'm gonna say is Sucker Royale. I don't know how many times I'm gonna say this map in this video, but it probably shows how terrible the map design of Sucker Royale is. If you're gonna make a long sightline map, at least the flanks you can take on attack. Javoltar Attack is also pretty weak for Cassidy. Echo. I think our best map is a wigsess goddance. There's a ton of cover, rooftops and flanks for you to land with stickies and beam combo, and I think if you're creative in Sucker Royale, she's surprisingly strong. Worst map is actually somewhat tough to choose for Echo. Comboys? I think she's really weak against Sumber Tracer, because she can't take a flank or an angle, so maybe new Queen Street if you're playing up against that specific comp. Long-range maps, what she has to close the distance, is where Echo can also be tough to run. Genji. Best map, and this might come as a shock to some of you, I think it's Ivana or Yelto. There's a ton of high-grunty can control and reach to, and up close, you can outdriller Widowmaker or an Ash on that high ground. Third point of honor though might be a struggle. With Worst maps, similar to Echo, I think Genji suffers more against the comps he plays against, rather than the map he plays on. But with that being said, I'm not a particular fan of Genji on legion or a wiser's university. I think they're too broadly for him to do anything on. Handsome. His best map I honestly think is King's Roe. Typically against dive, handsome is pretty weak, and he also does pretty well in bloody match-ups. King's Roe is classic for that, and third point also as high ground, the handsome can utilize. The worst maps I'd say are Elos Ruins, Nippo Village, and Legion Control Center, either too long sightlines or not enough angles for him to take. Then again, I am struggling on choosing our map where handsome really isn't that great. Genji. Of course he's going to be pretty strong on Legion Control Center, where just by accident his good-a-sour hit, but I think a total of peninsula is pretty underrated. What's up I think, is either Drunk Attack or Hollywood. Hollywood might be a weird choice, but on attack, I think he's really tough to pull off because of the sightlines and press the five grounds. And on defense, I just think there's better hero's to play. May. Thibes and maps where you can get guaranteed value from your wall. King's Roe, Coliseaux, a wiser's university, and Legion Control Center are obvious and basic picks here, but I can hold, barring second points, she's also pretty strong too. Maps with the geometry is more open, making beer struggle to run. New Queen's Street is a perfect example of such, and yes, I am aware of the stolen gimmick you can do, but apart from that, this is really not much going for me on this map. A wiser's city center, I also think she can struggle on. Far. I actually think she's very undevaided on Legion Control Center, because of the little bit of high ground you can use as cover. And for that same reason, Dorado, Rialto, New Queen's Street, and I can hold, can tend to be pretty strong for her too. Most specifically, the first points for Dorado and Rialto, tons of roofs and high buildings to use as cover. Most map is likely anything on an untaughted pinntula, sightlines are way too short and broadly, and their map is relatively open, meaning it's hard for far to use a concussive blast to close the distance. Reaper. Cover is really important for Reaper to close the distance safely, so an appall shrine, and taunted pit, and taunted penintular, but sand mechabase, or at least a single map, what every cos map is pretty good for Reaper. Reaper's biggest weakness, however, is his range. Good luck flanking and making sure that it's not telegraphed on something like Sochariol. Sojourn. Similar to most DPSs, I think you can get away with Sojourn the most maps, so choosing our best one is pretty difficult to say the least. I'd probably choose Rialto, Esperanza, or New Queen's Street, because of the rotations you can take the different angles, whilst also retaining a well-gun charge. Those maps also aren't too long sightlines. Her worse map on the other hands are maps where there's just other more fish and picks to choose from, which merely come down to compositions to be honest. Legion control centres up there, as well as any long range map too. Sojourn 76. This might be controversial, but of pot-fant-third points, Havana I think is really strong for Sojourn. Plenty of players to sprint and rotate too, and there's sightlines on too long. Essentially, just maps where you can sprint to different angles, I think can be pretty strong for Sojourn. Worst map might be Coliseaux. Sojourn doesn't have that much front line pressure, compared to someone like me, and angles you can take on Coliseaux for quite a vertical mobility, which Sojourn doesn't really have. Somer. Again, I think composition has to do a lot with where the sunbat is a good pick or not, instead of the map. Relatively open maps with sightlines that aren't too long, I think she's pretty good in, like a way to see centre, Illioswell, but sancentuary or new Queen Street. Her worst map is to have to say, because her worst heroes are cast the Enhanzo, who only need to land one or two shots to force translocates. As a result, Kinsu could be a solid shout, not to mention, Somer also can't access high grounds, unless she wasted her translocates. Sumetra. Thankfully, Sumetra is pretty simple. Her best map is likely Lee Zhang and my opinion, just generally speaking across all the maps. Short sightline and Roli, to allow her to get to level 3 beam, whilst also having classic teleport players for herself and her team. Worst map is probably so cute for real. The reason why I didn't pick Junketown is that whilst both maps are super long sightlines, so cute for real is very very linear until 3rd point, meaning it can be hard to flank with your T.P. Turbion. Widely enough, I think Torps best map is busy worlds. Some classic spots to put your toy on, and the sightlines suit tour pretty well. Generally speaking though, I think Torps is just too much to say. I think Torps is just better on defense than a sack. With Torps' worst maps, despite Torb lacking the range, making him not a great pick on sniper based maps, on attack, when trying to walk into an enemy team utilizing high ground, Torps is really gonna struggle. Washed put in your border, and Hollywood attack are great examples of such. Tracer. Best map is in the Queen Street, so many flanks to take, and not too much high ground from stopping you. Worst map is Kingsville. First point is too linear, and the flanks and angles you can take are typically on high grounds. Speaking said, Tracer's by no means a bad pick or a playable King Zo, which just goes to show how strong she is. Widowmaker. Best map is Ivana, Sokrui Al, Oberzan Downtown, and worst map is Lee Jankon Trowcenter. No discussion needed. Oner. The best maps for her are ones where you can get cheeky nades off on rotations. King Zo, Riyalso, even Antarctic Peninsula, and the Lee Jankon are poor maps, or pretty sort of picks for her too. With worst maps, I believe that ML 700 once said, her worst map was Illius Ruin's, because of how long the sightlines are, but the honestly aren't too many maps, which straight up unplayable to pick on her. Bap ceased. He thrives on maps with situations where you're running the hard wall comp, or where you're running hard poke comp. Zenbap is always going to do well on Sokrui Al, and Lucie Bap is always going to do well on Lee Jankon Trowcenter Peninsula. Individually, places where Bap ceased can get value of his exo boots, in order to deal damage, like boots 66, are also good places for Bap. As for his worst maps, again, it's mostly composition based. In other words, playing that piece with dive. And for that reason, I'd say watchpunch a boulder, or an abarney, could be weak for Bap, even though there's plenty of high grounds for you to exo job up to. Brigitte, as a glorified brighman myself, I have to say I love playing brigh on Devado. So many different angles and high grounds that you can control, I always get excited when I get Devado, since brigh is pretty free on both attack and defense. As for her worst map, it's got to be long range maps, or short ranged warning maps, when he might as well be playing Marcy, or lose your respectively. Junketown and Lee Jankon are good respective examples, though I will say, Sigma Brigh as a front line isn't half bad. KiwiCo, super versatile, but are best maps are ones where you can hard flank and teleport back to a team with relative safety. King's role on all three points is a perfect example of such, but you can honestly argue any map is KiwiCo's best, because that's how flexible she is. Her worst maps are ones that are super linear, and force KiwiCo into a healable playstyle, which isn't always a bad thing, but if you're running snipers, you might as well be playing Zen, which is why on Sakurai Al and Junketown, you need to be hard flanking. Life weaver, okay so moving on, Lucio. The obvious choice here is Elios, because of the reddit and boot potential, but speaking more competitively, I think Lucio is very strong and king's though, and real toe. Not just in terms of spitting the tank in, but also contesting high ground in the midfights 2. For general speed and braw though, Lee Jankon is always going to be a top pick. His worst maps are where you just don't need the speed boost and no combat mainly stationary, which is why for the 100th time in this video, Sakurai Al is once again another great pick for Lucio. Mosse. Any maps were arranged to hit scan, like Ash, Handso, Widow, Sogen or Soldier can do well on, she'll do well on 2. Route 66, Nubani, Esperanza, Rialto, and of course, the classic Long Range maps will suit mercies just fine. As for her worst map, Lee Jankon trowthens are just has to be it. Lee too short-sortenlined and very easy for her to get run over by a Lucio comp. Mosse. Loki, she's kinda stronger midtown. Fading to high ground and drilling DPS, as well as being within range to heal your team, is a pretty flexible playstyle. Kids wrote an icon world are also solid examples of this too. With her worst maps, I find that when people struggle with Mosse, it's more of a playstyle thing than a map thing necessarily. She's a budget curico, so a map's where it's super hard to flank, like on Sakurai Rial, for the 1000th time. She's probably gonna struggle. Zenyatta. Range is the name of the game Zenyatta, which is why caught maps generally speaking aren't really great picks for him. Of course, on your standard long maps, Zen is gonna do well in, but surprisingly, I don't think Lee Jankon trowthens is a terrible map for Zen, unlike a Mosse, which is mainly because of discord and Zen's own damage. Instead, I think something like Elio Slighthouse, which is super all-giffyzen's positioning, can really be a hindrance. And that's it for the video. Shout out to my tier 1 and tier 3 patrons, and let me know your own thoughts on below. Until next time.
