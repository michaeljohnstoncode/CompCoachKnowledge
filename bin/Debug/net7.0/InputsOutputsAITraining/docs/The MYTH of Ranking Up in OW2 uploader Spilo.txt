 You can climb with any hero out of any rank if you want to find what the most efficient way to climb out of Arankas then you're asking the wrong question Would you put and be playing mercy and low ranks? We know it's as slow as coming support from everyone who's done on ranked the jams. Yes Is this an ironic comment It's an ironic comment. Okay, I don't know if you're joking, but I'm gonna treat it like you're not joking just for the second Mercy is the slowest you don't play mercy and lower ranks if you're doing if you're smurfing No, actually go for it. Okay. Sorry. No disrespect But the reason why people say you shouldn't play mercy and lower ranks is because they've watched too many unrank the jams Is it the slowest climbing support? Sure? Your impact is lower than other supports, but it's still significant enough toward if you play mercy Any play mercy at a silver level you will climb out of bronze it might take you 15 20 30 games More so than like let's say a support that can carry more, but you can still do it The problem is as people watch too many unranked jams and think that only people that can kill six get out of unranked jams Right if I'm if I'm a grand master support player and plat Yes, the fastest way to climb is just to kill five, but that's a flawed reasoning Because when you're playing you're only goal is to play better than the enemy support counterpart and over the source of Serious of several games you will slowly slowly slowly rank up So the flaws that you should only play carry heroes out of low ranks But the problem is is that every hero is a carry hero and low rank if you play it well enough The problem is that people in low ranks just aren't good enough and the problem with saying that you need to play fill in the blank hero Is not that it's bad advice to play something that you know advising someone to play something, but it's the concept that Trying to tell people what to play for example Let's say there's something that really enjoys mercy, but they read and read it that you can't climb out of bronze playing mercy So they try to pick Moira, but they don't like Moira, so they don't get very good at Moira They get frustrated and they're stuck in the yellow hell. I like it. Looked out things with the sub you can climb with any hero out of any rank If you want to find what the most efficient way to climb out of arrankers Then you're asking the wrong question Because choosing your way out of a rank is not the same as improving and it's only a short-term solution Because what happens when you're in silver? You're gonna go back and play mercy, but you're still a bronze mercy. So you're gonna go right back to bronze So what's the point of climbing? What's the point out of choosing right how many how many people were heel-boughting and carry-co And got to grandmaster and then the hero gets balanced and they don't know how to play the game and they go right back to master's again or diamond why are we trying to cheese Instead of just get better at the game. It's such a short-term solution and it doesn't actually like if you want to play mercy in gold You need to learn how to play mercy and bronze and the problem is that people say well well You don't get low rings shut up You're totally wrong I've coach so many bronze and silver players and I What yes, and I was bronze myself you're totally wrong. It's just total fake news and cope that all doesn't work no it does you're just bad You're bad. It's okay to be bad, but don't sit there and pretend that oh it doesn't work in lower ranks It absolutely does you're just bad Oh offing those nobody takes my guess they do you're just bad. Well, I can't you know You can't wait to group up with your team because it listen you can't okay fine You can't play with five but then play with four group up with the majority of your team even if it's four if you guys staggered fine Fight with four people instead of five or three people. It's not five Mechanical expressions will get to you out of low ranks honing that sure that you can make a good argument that Improving mechanics is the best thing that you can do to get in the fastest way to get out of lower ranks But the problem with that is that honestly applies to every hero If mercy can improve for movement even to a base level to where you can just do a super jump or a Guardian angel cancel you will legitimately cut down in your dust by almost half Right And if I'm a person And even if you're within rights of direct mechanics in terms of hitting shots sure But what if do you want to encourage somebody who enjoys playing mercy to grind mechanics on a hero They don't enjoy to get out of silver and they go right back to bronze again playing mercy You kind of see what I'm saying so it's like it's even if you're right in terms of killing clicking heads is the fastest way to rank up and I think you're probably are It's still won't help somebody who wants to play mercy and plant how do they how are they gonna get there? They're not gonna get there by playing Moira. I'm gonna tell you that much And if they do then they're gonna pick mercy and they're gonna go right back now again They're gonna they're gonna get to plat or gold one tricking DPS Moira They're gonna pick mercy and sustain maintain like a 40% win rate with mercy and gold until the right back in silver again So you have to be really careful. I don't think the I that the thing is it's not just that the the idea itself is wrong It's not necessarily wrong. It's just it encourages players to do things that they shouldn't be doing Because I have more fun playing brick exactly dark aura That that's what you should be aiming for when you have fun playing a hero That's what you should be aiming for how does a brick and lower ranks climb right now I'm looking at dark aura dark way right now and I think dark way would do a little bit better to focus a little bit more on Pack usage making sure that we're not just using packs for no reason and trying to help our DPS or supports when they're taking place Right there It's not sexy. It's not flashing But it's good and it will help you and it's also not something that's oh, it's a cheese quick way to get to high rank You know, it's how you play break at every rank right at every rank So what will help you to get you to high silver? We'll also help you get you to gold and get you to platinum and diamond and so on so as you improve It's not a cheese. It's how you play their hero It's a very important skill for here heroes of all ranks, right? No, I disagree about the mercy thing. How does anything die in bronze if nobody hits their shots? Oh It's a question Olds do the trick usually. Okay, so then when mercy you damage with people who are playing aggressively with ultimates And maybe in lower ranks you have to be more dynamic with who you pocket and how you pocket But it doesn't matter if you pocket people who are growing aggressively with damage boost and low ranks. It's still useful I Hear a lot less of that clicking noise sure, but it will still but doing it better than other mercies is still gonna be useful If accuracy drops and bronze blue being values proportionally different than in higher rank absolutely But we're but remember the blue beam is only if somebody's not critical So what you might do is you might pocket aggression and lower ranks, but you have to spend more time healing than damage boosting because they're moving but also people low race have worse movement there so it's like I love blue beam focus is Less important in lower ranks than it is in higher ranks. You might be right There might be more efficient ways to climb as a mercy player maybe cutting down your deaths is more important Passy night But it doesn't matter been proving or blooping usage is still worth doing You
