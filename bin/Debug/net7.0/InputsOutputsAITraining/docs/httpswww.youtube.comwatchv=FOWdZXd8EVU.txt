 Winning Team fights in Overwatch 2 is ultimately the only thing that matters if you're trying to climb. But every single fight that you take is going to be fundamentally different, so how do you ensure that you are best equipped to win each one? Well in this video we're going to break down the different types of fights that you could have in Overwatch and things that you should take note of if you want to succeed. But do me a few thoughts and smash that like and subscribe if you enjoy the content, and let's jump right in. Now the first type of fight we'll talk about is the first fight, which is characterized by team spitting for the first time in any given round. Now this is important to distinguish because neither team are going to have either ultimate and no one is going to be low on resources when you first make content. Everyone's going to have full shield, all their abilities, all their health. And the most important thing that you could do to give yourself a chance of winning this first fight is gather information. How many times have you died right off the bat to a widow maker who didn't know existed? Or you get dove on by a Winston and they kill two people right away and you didn't even really know they had a Winston until he was already on top of you. Try to gather information about what the enemy composition is so that you don't get caught out by something that you don't expect. On top of that there's something weird that happens in a lot of these first fights on maps like push or maps like King of the Hill where there's a lot of neutral space that neither team controls but it's typically some objective. So we could think of the point the capture point itself that will unlock after a set amount of time or the bot where both teams could grab it back and forth but the trick here that you need to understand about first fight is that these objectives don't matter and oftentimes they are traps that you and your team want to more or less avoid. Now that seems kind of weird right? Caption of these objectives is the goal. Pushing the bot is the goal. Capturing the cost is the goal but the thing is whatever team wins that first fight will be able to easily capture the objective. If you capture the objective and your opponents kill you because you're in a worse position because you prioritize the objective rather than good positioning to win the team fight, you might get 5, 6, 7%, they're going to take it right back. You might push that bot to feet and they're going to push it 40 feet. That doesn't mean that you can't utilize these objectives to your advantage especially if your team benefits from the enemy taking the fight to you like you're playing a brawl composition or you're playing brawl characters that benefit from them taking the fight to point hypothetically then you can maintain that space on point denying line of sight and ultimately either forcing the enemy to come fight you on your terms or drag out the fight potentially giving your team a ton of free percentage. Now I do want to move on to talking about fights with control. Now what are I going to do by control? These are fights where you already control the objective or you are the defender you control the capture point that enemies are trying to take and these are fights where enemies have to push into or challenge the space that you and your team already have and there's going to be a defenders advantage here. And defenders advantage means that you are already set up on your strong positions with your cover and opponents have to find a way to move or set up in a position that challenges you. So this means like routing to the high ground hypothetically as attackers and as defenders you are looking to interrupt the setup of the enemy team. Oftentimes if you allow the enemy team to perfectly set up in the way they want to you give away a lot of that defenders advantage so when you have that high-grade advantage when you have your strong positions don't allow the opponents to route where they want to for free. But another really important thing though is that when you start to get a true disadvantage then you need to give up your space that you control and retake it later. So basically let's say your holding defense on an objective with your team and two or three of you have died instead of just fighting and dying right then in there because you could force that fight and die you want to give up space, give up objective, give up everything you possibly can and utilize time so that you and your team can regroup and you could potentially retake that space. You gotta understand that while trying to retake a space is hard it's harder to win in a number to disadvantage so we're going to take the lesser of two evils the easier option here and we're going to regroup with our team first as much as possible before we challenge them for those key objective points maybe giving them two ticks on an objective or waiting into the last possible second to actually commit to the fight. Now let's talk about retake fights and these are fights typically when you're trying to retake the space, retake the ground and this ties in directly into that situation where let's say you died two people died three people died you backed off away from a point they're about to capture all of y'all are back and now you have to repush in to space that the opponent's occupy. How do you do this? How do you actually have success doing this? It's not easy but it is possible. The version that you need to identify is are there going to be people that can contest before the opponent's cap and this is most common in like the third point of a payload right on defense let's take Kings Row the third right you're going to contest your opponents are all pushing the car if you're the person that needs to actually contest the objective then you need to try to play characters and play to contest the objective and this is going to really depend on who else is alive who else can touch if you're the only person that can touch in your support you better be swapping to a character like Lucio and you better be playing not to necessarily go for a high risk high reward play that gets you kills you want to play to delay for time by your teammates time if you're a DPS it can be tracer it can be may your Reaper if you're a tank it can be wrecky ball Winston Orion the idea here is that your goal if you are the one that has to contest space is just to the lady objective and prevent your opponents from winning but if you have at least one person that can occupy that role then what you can do is very very freed up you can go out and you can look to sustain them and heal them up and keep them alive so that they can start much longer you can go for a play where instead of just trying to help your team live you come out of spawn as a character that is going to actually target the back line sustainers the supports or the DPS in the back line that are constantly generating value and you look to cut the source as opposed to just fight the objective like for instance if you're trying to defend and there's a widow maker taking unlimited pockets at your team unless that would make your is dealt with your team is all going to die doesn't matter how long you stall for and that's actually the problem so in a way to think about it if the widow maker never gets killed then it's impossible for you to win now you can also come out of spawn as something super high risk car reward like the widow maker hypothetically a character that has the means and capability to turn a fight out of nowhere and how risky you play and what role you play during a retake is going to be dependent on who can contest the objective and what is needed for you to win sometimes you have to play for more of a risky play if you need a huge clutch up in order to win and you're going to play to that as opposed to play a way that my delay for a couple of seconds that is just a slow loss like you're not playing to win you're playing not to lose and you're just going to lose anyways of course this is going to be really different if you only need a stall like 20 or 10 seconds to get to that zero so that if you get over a minute they can't even attack but of course it's that specific situation but keep that in mind the nice thing that many to talk about is staggered fights and there's two types of staggered fights that's the type of fight that your being staggered and the enemies are trying to chase you out and kill you and there's also the ones where you're staggering the enemy team so that's the you win and kill some members on the enemy team you already captive objective a staggered fight is you're chasing them down oftentimes you're leaving one person on cart if anybody and you're going to try to kill every single last person that isn't killed here or maybe got the forward spawn and force them to get the much later spawn and the entire time you're getting more ultimate charge and delaying their inevitable second fight for much longer which is all an all a good thing now the only thing about a staggered fight that you need to consider is who actually got forward spawned how many of them did and you'll know that by when they died comparatively to when you kept the objective and how many teammates are with you because the idea is you always need a numbers advantage if the enemy tank and like to support spawn in and you and another DPS push up alone you could easily get the tables turned on you and that is the worst case scenario when staggering a fight and it can make it so you get staggered back or lose the ton of advantage and then the opponents can group up and fight much more for than they would before so that would be a way of that and don't be afraid to leave a staggered fight engagement if you don't see easy kills in front of you but as a team that is getting staggered or just in general where you're backing up let's say that the opponents have won the initial engagement you're backing up often times if opponents over extend a bit too much and you have a focus fire with like a duo you can turn the tables on targets really easily you know one on a shot into a Cassidy shot into just a person dying at a nowhere can all the sudden leverage some of this disadvantage and it's important for you to understand as someone being staggered when it's correct for you to run away completely and just get out of there so that you can't get chased down whether it's correct for you to fight and potentially try to find that disadvantage or whether it's correct for you to die and just go to the objective die forced them to clear you so that you get to reset with your team and these are going to be dependent on a couple of factors including how many players on the enemy team are alive what's the risk and reward difference between living and getting staggered versus dying and fighting and comparing and contrasting all these things. Now last but so many news let's talk about low resource fights and this is when your in a situation where you typically have to collect up you've all been there where it's like a 1v1 maybe it's even just like a 1v2 or something super super small everyone has low resources low health no one has full ample teammates maybe there's no support maybe there's no tanks and you need to try and do something to clutch up right now this is often where mechanics meets game sense because how you play in these situations are going to be very dependent on the information that you have the thing you need to ask is what is the win condition for the fight and let's say if you die the opponent's captain objective and if you kill them the opponents don't and your team will regroup with you and y'all will be able to hold but let's say in the fight your teammate died first your first teammate died first and they're not back yet but they will be in that situation you could easily turn that 1v1 into a 1v2 just by playing to stall for time you don't have to go and take a really aggressive 1v1 all you have to do is deny the capture and wait for your teammate to come back with you and then ultimately clear the objective as a 2v1 this means that time is your ally and survivability is the win condition as opposed to trying to go for a clutch up but let's say in the exact opposite situation you're fighting someone and you see their team coming and your team isn't there to help you yet going for a potential high risk cover ward play on the 1v1 can actually help to potentially even out the matchup this is where you go for something like a one clip on a tracer or go for a really high risk play where you're doing a target and you have to hit a lot of shots to win it's very similar to trying to retake before where if that widow just lived you were gonna lose inevitably and you have to take the risk to try to kill the widow instead of allowing her to just free shoot over your team and while your first instinct is to live and survive and make sure that you just don't lose played and not lose you actually have to play you actually have to play to win because playing not to lose will eventually make you lose because you have a fundamental disadvantage that is creeping up to you whether that's a teammate or grouping whether that's an ultimate coming up and it's really important that you not only try to perform mechanically well in these situations which of course you would but think it through try to play for the path of least resistance that's going to ensure the victory rather than betting it all on you making one proactive play when it really wasn't needed but if you have any questions about these then let me know in the comments down below but I hope you enjoy the content smash the like subscribe and I'll see you next time
