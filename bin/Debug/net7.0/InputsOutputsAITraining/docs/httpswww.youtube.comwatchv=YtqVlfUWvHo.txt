 What's up guys? It's me, Coach Mills here. Coming at you with a brand new birthday video. And we're doing the heavily requested target priority guides. You know exactly what characters to focus, win and wear in any given fight. We'll do my song and come check me out on the screen right now in the description down below. And let's jump into the video. Now we're gonna break this up into separate categories, tanks, DPS, and supports, primarily breaking down who you should focus and at what stage of any given team fight. So let's talk about tanks first. When are you supposed to focus a tank? Now whether a DPS, a tank, or a support, the majority of the time you're not supposed to hard focus tanks, because it's just overall gonna be a waste of time. Having two supports pump healing into a tank means that you're gonna waste all your time, all your attention, all your firepower, farming up a tank that gets healed instantaneous and you're gonna be generating 30% less old charge. Now that can't change if the tank is incredibly low and health and possible for you to burst down, if there is large amounts of focus fire, think a discord plus like three people shooting at the same tank, or most importantly, if the tank is super at a position. If there's a rhinoar in your backline, super out of line a side of his team, then of course, doesn't matter who you are, tank, support DPS, you should be shooting that tank. Now this doesn't mean that you could never poke at tanks, but typically you want to be exchanging resources, not exchanging health. Keep in mind that from a damage to healing ratio, healing is gonna rise up a tank so quickly and with all the damage mitigation, you're gonna lose that exchange one for one and they're gonna generate support, it's very, very quickly. At a much faster rate, then you are generating it by dealing damage, cause of that 30% less, and it just charges much less quickly. But if you're trying to poke down tanks resources, for instance, poke a tank so they use DM, poke a Ryan Shield so that your Sigma can break and win the shield battle, and you're trying to deny the Ryan Space. These could be some examples of when it actually is okay to poke at a tank's resources, but it's much more about the resources themselves, so that's easier for you to deny, hit abilities on them, and things like that. Now, one thing that you need to consider as a tank player up against the tank matchup, if there's a huge effective range disparity between you and the person you're fighting, then you can still poke at them, even if it's not optimal. So, normally, I would say, even as a tank tanks, focus the other tanks way too much, because they're gonna generate less old charge, their damage is less impactful, but if you're a Ryan heart, for instance, in your effective range on top of a diva, then swing away, because the exchange of resources is gonna heavily favor you, just because that tank doesn't wanna be right on top of you. Another example we could see is like a Ryan heart, swinging at a Sigma, or maybe a Sigma poking at distance from a Ryan, while they don't necessarily wanna high-profocus the Ryan, it's okay, if that's the only person you can poke at, as long as that Ryan is in his effective range on to you, he's basically useless, and while it's not perfect target priority, you can afford to have a much longer fight, because you're opponent doing less than you, which is like zero, while you're doing actually something because you're maintaining your effective range. Now, let's talk about focusing DPS. Who on the DPS roster should you be focusing? When you should be focusing DPS and why? Well, the biggest thing that you're doing when you're focusing a DPS is you are denying them opportunity. And this is one of the most important concepts that you need to learn from this video, and it's when a Cassidy goes on an off-angle, or peaks the high ground, or gets an aggressive flank off, damage will deny them from that play. It will force them to leave and go back, and basically limit their possibility. The longer that person gets to be exposed on that angle, the more risk your team is, and it's not just any specific role that can deny this, everyone can deny this. DPS support and tank, and this is one of the reasons why there's such a huge disparity as you climb up the ranks, and when you play in high rank versus some of the lower ranks, the amount of time that you have is much different. So, if you're a Cassidy peaking out, oftentimes you'll peek out, you get one or two shots off, and an honor will shoot you, a freaking random amount of damage from a tank will come out, a fire strike will come out, a Cassidy will shoot you in the body, or whatever the case may be, you're gonna take damage. The second you expose yourself, you only have a very short window of time before there's a response, and the lower and rank you go, the longer and longer that window is, before there is a response, and that's really the difference. That's why DPS Smurfs, even if they don't have amazing mechanical skill, much, much better, mechanics, much better, anything, because there's not a big enough response, and they know how to utilize that window, they are gonna be farming. And this is really how you deny. You need to understand it oftentimes, it's not about the kill, it's about denial of value, of course, getting a kill is fantastic, but a haunt to honor an off angle, or a haunt to being allowed to shoot five, 10 times as long as another haunt, so it's gonna get that much percentage of value more. So, it's really important that you understand this concept. Now, another thing that's really important to force is cooldowns, and this is a really important target priority, especially when you're playing up against the dive, doesn't really matter what character you're playing and what role you're playing once again. It matters that you're forcing out their cooldowns that will deny aggression. So as an example, if you focus again, and he uses his deflect early, he's not gonna be able to engage into it, gets his deflect back, or when he does engage, it's much easier to deal with them in that moment, because he doesn't have deflect, and it's more likely that you're gonna deny him from getting any value. Just like what the Tracer oftentimes, a Tracer comes in, your goal is to force out as many cooldowns as possible, and force that Tracer to recall. Not necessarily force recall, force cooldowns, and then Chase to Tracer around the map. You're not trying to necessarily kill this person. You're trying to deny them, deny them value. That's what it's all about up against CPS. It's denied, denied, denied. You're not necessarily trying to outright kill the farer. You're trying to make it so as she exists anywhere in a range or a space that can really, really punish your team. She gets hurt from that, and she has to play either super, super passively, or if she doesn't, then she will die, but it's not the death that matters necessarily. It's more about denial of value, and we know this because we've often gone up against a farer emergency, or we played a farer mercy on our team, and it felt like the farer mercy didn't get enough value to justify those two slots. Most of the time it comes from the farer getting denied of value, and then never being able to be aggressive enough to actually go for something, if they try to force it and die, then you'll typically see a swap. So this is the goal, this is the idea, and like I said, any single person can deny. Every single role can deny. Now some characters are gonna be able to do a better, of course, depending on what character they're up against. For instance, characters like Cassidy and characters like Hanzo with a lot of matter burst damage are gonna be able to force cooldowns from a tracer faster, and they're typically gonna be able to get those characters away quicker, but it doesn't mean that getting shot by an on-up, getting hit by a cure-co, getting flail by a break, so that they have to stay in the fight longer, and they have to use more cooldowns, isn't effective. All of these things are effective, and it's important to understand that the goal with DPS the majority of the time is that denial, but that still doesn't mean that you can't die of a DPS. It's so does it mean that you can't go after and punish a DPS. And most of the time, this is from dive compositions, where they want to specifically shut down the target. So oftentimes, if you're playing a dive, it is correct for you to jump the actual DPS, and not necessarily the supports. Especially if a support has a lot of mobility, diving a cure-co pretty hard to do, and not typically that efficient, but if you dive like a Hanzo, not only do you put the supports in a word situation, where they have to bail out the Hanzo at the risk of their positioning, which could get them all killed, but, and this is the most important thing, the Hanzo is gonna be under more pressure, and hopefully killed because he's forced and targeted, so not only does he get removed from the battlefield, but he has less of a window to actually interrupt the engage. Because the worst thing that could happen to you is you go in, let's say you trace her, get in G, Winston, jump and on her, and while you're doing that, the Hanzo Dinkcher Tracer. And then while you're trying to clean up, the Hanzo, body shots, and storm arrows are Winston. So because this guy was left uncontested, he had a really long amount of time to interrupt the fight, and this is another thing about denial, right? It's the same concept just in a more aggressive way to the idea that you need to deny the enemies from peaking certain areas and occupying certain areas that they could be effective, just like you target one of these characters in a dive, the idea is to shorten the window of time that this DPS could be effective, because the longer they're allowed to exist, and be in line of sight of your team, the more they could have an impact over the fight, and you would much rather put it on the supports to have that window. And it's your job, by the way, as someone that is being targeted, whether you're a support or a damage to either, that you're trying to interrupt and respond. Think about it this way. If you're an Anna and your Hanzo gets dove, your Hanzo was dove because they don't respect the value that you could bring, and it's your responsibility to do something because you were specifically not targeted. In the same way that if the auto's dove and your Hanzo, it's your job to do something because you were specifically not targeted. It's your job to respond to these targets because if they are not focusing you, and you don't do anything about it, then your teammate is getting shut down, and you are not leveraging the fact that you have a certain longer window of time to interact with them than your teammate does. And this is really important from a defensive point of view, and really important for you to understand, I know we're getting into some more advanced concepts here, but if you have any questions, definitely let me know on-stream in the links down below. Now last but certainly not least, the supports, which is kind of like the bread and butter, the caviar, the fucking golden egg that you're trying to go for, whether you're a tank and DPS or even a support, most of the time you want to get a pick on a support at all possible. And of course, these are the characters that you really want to shut down because the lack of sustain is gonna allow you to win, and elongated fight, and typically, it's gonna allow you to win a fight very quickly if you can get support kills, but they're hard to get than others, primarily because of their passive positioning, and the fact that they don't have to be going for anything nearly as much as DPS or tanks, they don't have to be taking space in the same way, they get to be protected somewhat, so all and all supports are harder than other characters to focus and shoot at. Now, it's especially if supports are in a decent position, and together. So let's say, an honor and burger sitting next to each other, a care-coach, Zander sitting next to each other. These characters are really hard to deal with. You can't commit to them, it's hard to poke them over any long period of time, unless you have burst, you're not gonna be able to realistically kill two supports that are together, unless maybe you have like a three or four men dime going all together. But this is the thing that you don't understand is that there's a cost to support its playing passive like this. If they're playing in the super passive optimal position, then they are not able to have any aggressive impact over the fight, at least not at a large rate, because of their passive positioning. They're gonna be doing less damage potentially, they're gonna have less impact for ability use, and this means that you don't necessarily have to hard-focused the supports, denial of the DPS looking to punish them, and making sure that the supports have to find ways to impact and help their team is a way to get them to slip up, because the most important thing about finding an opportunity to punish a support is taking note of their cooldowns. This is what it's really all about, because supports when it has a Nade and a sleep, and a Kereko has a Suzu and a Teleport, a Lucy has a Boo and an Ampup, all of these characters are very, very, very hard to punish if and at all, if they're in a good position, if they have their cooldowns, but as a fight plays out, as you deny the value that a DPS is getting, as you make sure that the tank is not necessarily effective playing in your optimal range, and as you bait out cooldowns as the fight progresses, there's gonna be more and more windows where you could actually punish, and I want your punishing, if you're ever going aggressive on a support with good positioning, especially if they're playing together with other people, you need to know what cooldowns they have, and there needs to be a reason for you to go after them, you don't wanna just be diving in on it that's next to a break, if that ona has all her cooldowns, but perhaps if she has no Nade, no sleep, then it actually makes sense for you to be aggressive with them, and I also wanna make it clear that just because you're not a DPS, supports and tanks can punish supports all the same as DPS can, maybe not the same tools in their arsenal, but a Dva flying at an isolated support or support that's at a position low cooldowns can kill them very, very quickly, just like how, if you're an ona, you can nade the enemy ona and shoot her, and basically kill her if she has any other damage onto her, plus she can't bill herself out with self-nade, so there's a lot of ways from pretty much every role and every character to interact and find value up against these characters, but it's kinda interesting how tanks are aggressively positioned, but you're not supposed to focus them, DPS are typically aggressively positioned, and you're supposed to deny them, and supports are defensively positioned, but you're supposed to punish them only when they don't have cooldowns though. But anyways, this is a general target priority guide. I could definitely go into more detail if I talk about specific roles and specific characters, which we plan to make in the foreseeable future, so smash that like, subscribe if you wanna see that, and check me out on Shimmer right now, your boy is 26, I know I'm getting a little bit old, but, you know, come check me out, and thank you so much for coming by, I'll see you next time.
