 What I need to do with Anna is I need to ask myself should I be healing? Or should I be damaging? You need to be thinking about I need be putting up pressure constantly and you're not doing that to carry the game or to be like You know, I'm gonna be you're doing that because that's what you're team needs your team needs you to be doing damage So that they so that they will take less damage if I should shoot the Genji once or the Tracer once They're put a pot shot in his denyon on the back line That reduces the damage that my team takes because those targets will have to back up for a little bit now They're not putting up pressure and there's for my team is safer so for right now Okay, my bots low. I got a heal him but I do not keep healing my bot right now Have you see this 20 damage? This this is this is not enough This is not helping him. He doesn't really need that. He's not under risk of dying. It would be better here Is to go oh shoot he's critical heal him up now damage with damaging him. Okay. Oh, I'm gonna damage him again Okay, now heal him now him. Okay. He's low. He's low. He's low. He's low. Can I say if I damage you? If he takes a little bit of damage. Okay, now he's low. Okay, we're good. You know, that's the mentality you have to be out with on And that goes with not just your gun, but also your cool nuts, all right So healing a damage and making that decision constantly all right sleep dark Do I want to be looking for aggressive sleep darts? Okay, where I like I could try maybe get in you know a big kill in the back line or a kill the tank or Is that going to me that I'm going to die because the wrecking ball Winston and so on are going to be able to jump in kill me afterwards, right? That's the question Do I save my sleep dart to keep myself alive so that I can keep putting up pressure or Do I use my sleep dart aggressively and so you see how looking at the enemy's composition or looking at the situation You could decide do I need my sleep dart to keep myself alive if not then I need to be trying to look it to use it aggressively Generally, yes, defense of sleep is going to be better Heck, you could even take an aggressive position and bait enemy's on top of you and have your sleep dart as you're good out Jill free card But your mindset needs to be do I need to keep it myself alive if not I need to be using it offensively now Nate is another one a little bit like that now that one of the greatest things about these support changes in overwatch Two is the fact that I have my support passive right so I should need very often to have to use my need for Self-heal if I'm playing it properly or unless I'm being dope right so for Nate Very high value. I'm trying to serve offensive value anti-nade. Don't only does damage, but it prevents them from being healed Which generally is more valuable than healing your teammates So one of the things that separates really the most important thing that separates on is From each other is the honest that are actually able to put out offensive pressure kill threat pressure with anti-nade Without significantly compromising their survivability. You see finally in a really big anti-nade But it cost me my life to do that then it you know Was that burst of pressure worth me being in spawn for the next 15 20 seconds trying to come back to the fight However, the opposite is also true where we have honest playing safe playing safe and missing Opportunities to threaten kills on the enemy team whether it's the DPS the tank the supports or whatever And then and by doing so their team loses the fight because the enemy supports are putting out more pressure than you are and And then now the same thing goes with the nano the same thing goes the nano Do we do it directly and go fan Kimner boy, woo, right and go in there and do a lot of kill pressure on the enemy team nice job on a Or do I wait until there's a lot of kill pressure on a specific target and then alleviate that pressure by supporting them helping them with nano Do I nano to save somebody's life or do I nano offensively And a tricky you see it which one's gonna get more value? Here's a question for you guys for me to nano a wise nano Winston a good target Wise nano Genji a good target He can get to an aggressive position exactly so when I nano a Winston Usually I'm not worried that they're not gonna be able to get anything out of it They have mobility therefore they know that they can get kill threat with that right even an an Orion hurt sometimes They're maybe they're too far away. They use charge They don't have speed it's a risk sometimes, right? But in nano Winston or nano Genji you know that they have the speed to be able to get kill threat with it right So how do you use nano if you don't have heroes that have a lot of speed or Lot of mobility you see how it's more of a risk you have to have more confirmation that that person is being fought on our chase or beat on and Then maybe you have to reactively nano them You guys remember how some of them is an overwatch So you don't know if you guys are watching much this weekend, but you saw sometimes nano's in yana. Why well at some point If you don't have a really aggressive dive tank it might be better to just go like I don't want to risk wasting an nano and then just not being able to get to anything I know they're going for my Zen they've got dive heroes right they're gonna go for my Zen So you know what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna deny their kill threat on my Zen with this with it with an anor You know obviously the fundamentals when it comes to to to Deciding whether to heal their damage which one's gonna put out or alleviate more pressure Sleep dart and my going to significantly increase my chances of death by using the sleep dart now I'm not having it later and my missing opportunities to need offensively can I use my native offensively and The last one guys when it comes to positioning Cover I know I've said it before, but I'm gonna say it for every year cover there is almost never Ever any downside to cover whether you're playing aggressively or defensively cover is what's going to increase your pressure by keeping you alive longer it might not always keep you alive forever You might not be able to play cover all the time but the priority was whether I'm going in hyper-abressive I want a battle on a then I'm doing it here because this is just allows me to play so much more safe And the funny thing is is if you don't play cover Oftentimes it actually means that you put up less pressure not just because you die But like let's say I'm playing no cover here and I'm like oh crap crap crap crap crap I'm running away because I'm being shot because I'm out in the open When I'm running away I'm not putting up pressure Right so when I play cover I'm not as concerned about being shot so I can relax and I could be an offensive minded on it because I know there's a significantly less chance to die And I start to get shot I'm fine and I can just keep repeating my whole mindset right now is Can I put out offensive pressure right now? What's the most valuable thing for me to be doing right now? Is it to heal my Cassidy who's at 177 HP or is it to shoot slash Nade this junker queen that's trying to provide pressure onto my Cassidy. What's better right now? It's tricky isn't it it's tricky shoot queen sleep queen Nade queen maybe put one shot my Cassidy maybe put a couple shot and we try to go for the sleep Nade shot on the The queen and then try to heal my Cassidy immediately afterwards you guys see what I'm saying though This is what we have to be looking for today I'm not gonna tell you exactly how to play the hero I can't nobody can do that anybody says they can do that their liars what I am gonna tell you is exactly what you need to be thinking about And what you need to be looking for in your own gameplay So shoot cast and queen then cast and queen could be right so let's see let's slow it down There's the shout so right now shout has been used how much what should we do right now? How much HP does this queen have for 27 how much kill pressure comes from a 75 damage shot on a tank That has 427 HP Right so now we go there's no point shooting the joker queen because it's gonna take way too many shots for me to actually threaten a kill So now I'm either going to heal sleep or Nade probably I would probably heal and then look first sleep dark Okay great job not executed perfectly, but they heal and the Nade not only kept your Cassidy alive But you just punch that joker queen right in the face screw off I guarantee we'll lower in gunna would have focused on only healing Cassidy and maybe not done enough damage or an anti-nade to the joker queen and that might have actually killed your Cassidy Maybe not but that's what we're looking for You
