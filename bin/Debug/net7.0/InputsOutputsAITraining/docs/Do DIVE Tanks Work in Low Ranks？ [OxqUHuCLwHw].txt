 So you're saying like my team like as struggles to like capitalize off of that they don't know how to they don't need to know how to But usually like on console, maybe our lower ranks dive tanks are like they're like they're seen as like I know like throwing really? Yeah, because like you're not really like you're not in the front lines. Right. Well, like protecting your team really. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It takes a different understanding of tanking than from a lot of people are accustomed to you know. Yeah, I think the irony here though is that like even the name tank is technically accurate But somewhere along the line, I guess it's with the birth of mmo's, you know World of Warcraft back in the late 90s or whatever people got the wrong idea You know like what is a tank like a real tank and battle, you know It's a big burly thing that hurts people, you know does it take tank provide cover? I guess but it's not meant to protect you, you know what I'm saying It's meant to like if you're a foot soldier, you don't look at a tank and be like, ah sick guys We've got a big shield to hide behind, you know what I'm saying? It's that guy is going to hurt the enemy team Let's play around that hurt that chaos and damage that's going to to provide right and that's how it protects you It's a threat that the enemy team has to give attention to so and that's what it allows you to be safer Right if a Winston's diving backline, you don't got to worry about on me or discord or sleep dart or or or the Cacity on the backline, right? This just the enemy tank and what other dps. It's removing threats from the battlefield Do you kind of see what I'm saying? Yeah, now there are aspects of tanks that can protect you right ryan shield theoretically can protect you sometimes diva matrix can Sorry bubble, but those those abilities really serve a dual purpose as like enabling the tank to do whatever he or she wants to do Too right like matrix can be used very selfishly Ryan shield is and generally most of the time used to help the Reinhardt stop taking damage not his team. Does that make sense? Yeah, so I guess kind of thinking about it that way can sometimes allow you to feel A little bit more clarity about what your role is. It's to protect through punishing. That's what your job is Most of the time most of the time and that's why a lot of lower ranked players are like, hey Can we get a shield tank mid rank? You know, but but you don't want a shield tank You just want an effective tank a ball that's you know distracting four members of the enemy team half the game is unbelievably valuable Because if they're distracted, they're not shooting you and that's just as good as a shield You kind of see what I'm saying. Yeah um, I feel I feel like people People people like don't understand that and so they don't really take advantage Well, that that that that's the other misconception, right? That's the other misconception and that's your misconception So people are like a lot of people don't in low ranks don't take advantage of a diet thing That's false. You just need to know when to be capitalizing off of that distraction So a lot of people it's like um, it's summer players have this. Oh, whenever I hack people people never go in. We'll stop Were they actually in a position to go in? You know like if you're going in as ball You don't need people to dive with you for it to be effective. You just need people to be shooting Anything for it to be effective. Whether that's the enemy rhinos shield or the enemy backline or the enemy dps Anything if I'm a sombran. I'm hacking zinata and then the ana goes to peel And our team is shooting the Reinhardt shield that Reinhardt is not receiving healing for two three four five six seconds, right? That's value you don't need your team to follow up off of it So you're saying like my team like as struggle is to like capitalize off of that. They don't know how to They don't need to know how to You need to make sure that you're doing your end of things correctly and it will just magically happen on of its own The only downside Is that sometimes people will mental boom because they're you're playing a hero that they don't like Yeah, you've had that happen before Yeah, I guess like yeah Yeah, that's unavoidable, but that's just a small detail You know like it's going to be a certain percentage of games that people are going to get mad because you're playing fill in the blank hero Um, but that's not that's going to have a pretty small effect on your sr I would say maybe 100 sr, you know or the equivalent of like, okay I'm plat five and plat four and and honestly that's only going to get better as time because as you climb and rank people Generally tend to care less which is I think a little bit ironic, but um Yeah, does that all make sense? Yeah, got it. Yeah, okay. Now. I know that's not going to necessarily make you feel any better when you got some like 12 You'll scream any year to get off and play shield tank But uh, you know that that's the reality of the situation and so you should never feel guilty about playing something that you enjoy Because oh, I don't know if my teammates are going to follow up off of it. That's a that's a that's a u issue Which is good because it puts it in your control, right? You
