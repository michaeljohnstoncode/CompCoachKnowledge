 Every hero in Overwatch has multiple strengths and depending on the situation you need to adjust how you play. Generally it's more, I would not necessarily say, change your full team comp to deal with a Pharma scene. But what is required is adjusting your playstyle. Lucio Moira. And how many times have you guys seen this? Moira sits there and heals the tank or tries to right-click the Pharah or the Lucio tries to just sit in the back. No, no, no, no, no, you have to adapt, you have to adjust. Okay, they're on a Pharma scene, we can't directly help versus the Pharma scene, so we need to find value elsewhere. Right? And I think that's where people struggle with. Is they don't know how to adjust playstyle. It's not just about adjusting playstyle, but so many people have like a total myopic view of their hero. You know, the only thing that this hero does this and they don't think about this hero also does this, like Moira for example. How many low rank Moira's? Only DPS. How many low rank Moira's? Only heal tank. But in actuality, Moira is good at both and depending on the situation, depends on which one is more important or doing both. Lucio, better to peel, better to dive. It depends on a better to snipe, better to get up, get in there, get your hands dirty. Brig, better to peel, better to brawl. Reinhardt, better to win the tank trade or pin backline LH Cloudy style. You guys get what I'm saying? And the problem is is that every hero in Overwatch 2 for the most part has a lot of those dynamics. I did that life-over video just the other day. We talked about how there's like four different things that life-over brings to the table. And each situation demands you to think about which one of those things you bring to the table, but people don't do that. People don't adapt to playstyle. Every hero in Overwatch has multiple strengths and depending on the situation, you need to adjust how you play. For example, if you're playing Reaper in a pharmacy, you can absolutely play Reaper in a pharmacy. You know how you play Reaper versus pharmacy? You avoid the pharmacy and you get value elsewhere. In fact, it's very, it can be good on certain maps because the Reaper is somebody that can punish the lack of a second support and the lack of a second hits again. Really hard. Tracer, I made that video on Tracer versus pharmacy, right? It's one of, actually that might be my biggest YouTube short. I don't, I don't really remember. And the way that Tracer deals with pharmacy is avoiding pharmacy, going elsewhere. Like pharmacies over here, avoid pharmacy, right? Find value elsewhere. And that's why a lot of these Overwatch 2 heroes like Sojourn and Kiriko, like even Reinhardt's little bit of his rework or trying to think what else. Sombra, right? Sombra's a big one. Ana, a lot of these heroes have a lot of nuance how they can play. They're very flexible. And if you're not like utilizing that flexibility, you're going to have a really, really hard time. I think one of the most challenging things that I ever did was play Brig into spam. How do you play Brig into Pharah? Chat, how do you play Brig into Pharah? Yeah, you literally, you literally have to flank because what are the Brig strengths? Well, Peel and Brawl. Like she's pretty good and squishy 1v1. She's not amazing, but she's pretty good. Like she kind of choose her engagements. She goes in, she starts to lose. She can bash out or just shield out. So what I ended up learning is that whenever they go like Pharah Reinhardt, whenever I can, I try to take off angles and try to like actually contest the other support or the other DPS. Like try to duel the other support DPS. Right. Now that one is a tough one. But again, if I had sat back there and tried to peel Pharah Reinh, you know, I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to die. Right. Now is Brig the most optimal choice in that composition? No, but it can work. It can work. It can work just fine. So I leverage her 1v1 capabilities because that is a strength of Brig. But don't you, doesn't your team call you a feeder if you do that? Yes, because that's a lack of understanding. And the question that you were have, was it you that asked the second ago? I just missed that. I just got your question. No, why do people not understand this? I don't know guys. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, to be fair, a lot of things come naturally to me because I've been studying this game for years, but this is why I try to make videos like this so that hopefully more people can understand. Good thing is, is that if your team calls you a feeder, but you do it anyway, more often than not, even if your team thinks you're feeding, you're going to get more value. I think that was like the dive tank video posted today. It's like, what do I do with my team? Like things I'm trolling because I'm playing a dive thinking bronze. Doesn't matter. It's still going to be the right play. Is it going to fail a couple of times because your team is going to personally sabotage you because they think you're doing the wrong thing? Yes. Yes. But more often than not, it's going to work. A lot. I had a coaching session the other day with a widow player and he was talking about how he's like, you know, I'm not swapping versus counters. I'm, you know, you've convinced me I'm not swapping versus counters. I'm not swapping, right? I'm hard forcing it, but I'm struggling. And I, and my first question was, are you adjusting? And he goes, well, you know, and sure enough, we take a look at the review and the guy's aim was actually pretty good. But, you know, Winston on the flank, you know, Tracer just doesn't change place at all. Does not adjust whatsoever and dies repeatedly. And that's where we had to like work at that and be like, listen, you could, you should hard force widow. But you got to adjust my point when I tell people not to swap. I'm not saying I'm I'm not saying you shouldn't adjust. You need to adjust. The point is to stick with a hero, adjust your place off. And if you don't know what you should be adjusting, think about your hero strengths. Experiment. So I think it's like, you know, how you use grapple in a widow one to one and how you use grapple versus a Winston or two very different things. I do think people are afraid to experiment most of the time. I think so too. It's it's easier to play the safe play like, you know, heal bot or play with your team and then blame, you know, something else other than yourself. Right. It's hard to limit testing experiment with things, make mistakes and then take responsibility for, you know, trying something about it not working. Right. But the ultimate thing is that you have to willing to lose some stuff to figure something out. So I don't know. It's an interesting conversation. It's an interesting conversation. It's an interesting conversation. And one I wish was talked about more because, you know, give credit to the Overwatch two devs in this regard is that they have done a pretty good job of giving a lot of heroes a fairly dynamic identity. Even little things like we talked about Reinhardt's charge being on a lower cooldown, you know, stuff like that. That goes a long way for giving Reinhardt different options. Brig shield bash, not stunning. That sucks. But it now goes further. So that completely opens up her options. She's a little bit weaker peeling dive, a little bit weaker versus peeling dive, but she actually has a lot more options in other situations. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, we had to learn how to adjust play cells. We had to learn how to completely adjust positioning. Right. Thanks for watching.
