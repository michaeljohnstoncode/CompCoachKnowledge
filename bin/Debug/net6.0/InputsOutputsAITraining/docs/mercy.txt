 Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, math control, math control, math control, the two things that we're always considering. Do you guys see this? Who is the most aggressive member of your team that you can safely follow right now? Cassidy or Farah? Not our tank and support line. If you're on a dies here, we can live with that. The highest return on investment for controlling the map, controlling your threats, and winning the fight is helping these guys out. Honours got the tank, right? And even if we have like a zinniata there, I probably would have just prayed at my guy a risk of didn't feed, because even if my risk of struggles, my DPS were in such aggressive positions. You guys remember the Brigida fodder of your own blows at the world? The same thing where my tank might suffer, but my DPS will be victorious and will win the map as a result. That's kind of what you have to learn here, right? Because right now again, we're defaulting Lobim. This target needs Blue Beam, not Lobim if anything. And then also is this the best target to pack? Is the Farah not a better pocket considering that she's also playing relatively aggressive? The answer is of course yes. Look at what's happening. Look at where the fight is. I feel like this is like, oh, I don't want to leave my Ana. Well, you're leaving your Farah. Who is in a position to need help more? Your Ana or your Farah? There's nothing inherently virtuous about being a support buddy. I feel like we see these Overwatch names about, oh, the mercy that he'll, the mercy that's actually healing. Oh, I love you, mercy. No, no, no, no, no, when, when, when the game support support. Beat the best mercies win games and they support their DPS and their tanks and their sports on a knee-to-no basis, you know, or a knee-air knee-to basis. Right now you're on a dusty attempt. Your Farah needs help. She needs her help. No other support can do this. Is in Yada Harmony Discord would be better than a mercy being here, but is in Yada can't get here a mercy can. Do you see how every support has a little advantage here and there, right? A little, a little thing that makes them unique in how they control space. Right. If I can help my Farah, like is this Farah feeding? No, as far as taking a good flank. If she gets a mercy pocket, the soldier 100% dies and she goes again and barrage back on it again. And you win the fight. Again. But you're on helping her. You're just helping, you're just helping it and look, look, look, look, look, look, look, stop you. Stop feeling, okay, quickly as you can get back to DPS. We're so focused on this front-line Tincture, like you must, oh no, I'm really concerned. You got lucky. You got lucky. You're, you're DPS had to win it without you. And look at this, your Farah loses the flank. Careful. I want my Farah, I need my Farah on the flank there. It's a really good Farah flank. There's not a lot of good positions in this point. This is good. Nice job paying attention to that, by the way. But that's the goal. When we're playing this hero, this is what we need to aim for. Yes. Yes. Careful. Keep some distance. See, you can keep both of these, you can keep, look, look, look, look, look. This is perfect. This is perfect. This casting would not be able to play by himself. He would have to get stuck on the floor and shoot nothing, or he would have to take a really high risk late flank play. Careful. You need to be careful with your positioning a little bit though. That's something we need to practice. But look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. Look at how much space that we are creating right now. Look at this. As long as we can survive this, oh, we're moving kind of awkwardly. This is monstrous value. We just had three people chases. Brilliant job. We're missing our beam. There we go. Be careful. Bigger, we're too close. We need a particular, a particular. Nice. Oh, two-closed, two-closed, two-closed, two-closed. Look at this. Look at this. Look at this. We have legitimately just one the fight from pocketing it off, the most aggressive DPS. That was also safe, right? Because this was a lot safer than running around on point. And the thing is guys, I'm not just saying pocket your DPS forehead, right? Pay attention on what's going on around you. Is your DPS playing aggressively? Can you even play aggressively with a DPS or would you die immediately for it? Right? There's a lot of nuance here. That was really well done.
