 The way I look at Arissa is sometimes you go poke poke, sometimes you go, that's pretty bad. Okay. As simple as you can. That's all there is to it. Who do you go, two on the entertainment team? None of it's who do you run over and you know, six year old. I can, I can easily, I can run over a hansa if I just get. And into him, um, the Anna, if I'm, if I play around a cooldown as well, um, and then the mercy if I can, yeah, beer her. Okay. So when you poke you poke me, probably the hansa. Yeah. And so I can close that. Maybe, maybe you have to be careful about that. Because you have no way to damage mid-a-gate without using your jab and spend so theoretically, if he's hitting his shots, you gotta be careful at that. Right. Yeah. So you're going to lose that HP trade. So then who do you poke poke? The mercy. Sure. Genji. Right. Do you? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Okay. So then this is this is the nuance of a risk that you're playing a very mid-range hero. And you're also playing a hero that's very honor very off to putting in the status of a cooldown. So hey guys, this is the in-depth arusic guy talking specifically about playstyle and how to play versus different compositions. Talking about positioning target priority, cycling your cooldowns, and much much more. Now, I don't go in as detail and all this tiny little tips and tricks that you can find in other videos about arusic. I want to teach you guys actually how to play the hero. One thing that I don't go in as detail in this video that I wanted to elaborate on just a little bit further before we get into the video is her ultimate. Now, arusic ultimate is unique in the fact that it actually activates a cooldown 4 to 5 while she's using the ultimate. So how to use this ultimate? Well, there's really two ways that you can use it. You can either use it to just simply assassinate her pressure at the enemy backline by extending your life. In other words, when I go in, I'll use my 4 to 5. Let's say that I've used up Javelin's spin. It's going to be a brief period of time where I don't have any defensive cooldown, and I'm very very vulnerable. I can use my ultimate then to provide that 4 to 5 survival ability that otherwise wouldn't be given to me. Now, when I'm thinking about it in terms of a survive ability standpoint, it does mean that I might not be able to choose the targets that I exactly want to go for. So the other way that user arusic ultimate is just offensively, you're going to find generally in a mobile squishy or squishy that doesn't have escape cooldowns at that point. Maybe a curico with that T.P. and Ana, Hanzo, and so on. And I'm going to walk up to the minute press my ultimate. Now, a lot of you guys really like to go for that planchon. And a lot of the time, that's the best use for the ultimate. But sometimes you're not going to be able to get that one shot before they escape the circle of your ultimate. So in circumstances like those, it's actually just totally fine to pull a little bit sooner, just to put out 130, 140, 150 damage. That's a lot of damage, guys. Even if you don't get the one shot, leaving them very vulnerable, forcing a lot of cooldowns, and allowing you or your team afterwards to follow up. So a highly recommend either using your ultimate as a way to extend your defensive cooldowns to go from, I don't have 4 to 5, but I can go in and just use my ultimate to give me some extra survivability and depression in the team, or you can use it to try to watch out squishies and really backlight. If you have any questions, please let me know in the comments and enjoy the video. Now, this is what separates men from boys. Okay? You're trolling. All right, you can't be here. You can't be here. You need to anticipate your immediate and painful death right now. Because your cover usage is not amazing. There isn't a lot of great cover here. There's just the nature of them at right, but you just quote unquote, wasted 4 to 5. Maybe it was okay. Like it was, it was at the worst warfight in the world. Quonico, wasted, javan's been okay. You're, you're, you're, you're, you're cooking. I have no cooldowns, and I'm just staring at the enemy team. Right, you're cooked. Yeah, you're cooked. You should die here. Oh, but you see how even inside curico ultimate, you almost died. Yep. You got to know. I tried to spend that on the other arm. I will say this as well. We're here for to fight here. Just shoot. Okay. Those men, just shoot. You do more DPS shooting than you do spending. I know what you're trying to do with the spend, but it would have been better to shoot him. He would have died here. Yeah. And then obviously, and then I would have spent for the new. Have you? Right. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. See, this, this is what you have to do. This is like, this is like the Erissa bait, where you are thinking, oh, I've used one cooldown. Let me just use the other because it's ticky, ticky, ticky, ticky, and fun, and shooting, and damage. Like, okay. So the ultimate gets no value. Right. Unfortunately, the javan also gets no value. That sucks. Yeah. So then we're shooting the Doomfist because it's the only thing that we can see. I fortify because I get low. Unfortunately, we're really, really really really squishy. Okay. Yep. Why on earth do you travel the spend this? Hmm. Yeah. Let's make a whole lot of stuff. See, the problem here. I'm being tough on you, but the problem with this is that it's not just the fact that you're layering your defensive cooldowns instead of not your layering, you're stacking. You're doing it the same time instead of one, then the other, then one, then the other. But also when you're fortifying, what's the pass of benefit of fortifying? The cooldown, right? You reduction. So your gun is that much more effective and yet you're your javan spending. So unless you have a really good reason to display somebody, or you're like literally one HP, I'm going to die. I need to try and javan spend this, even with fortify. This is this makes no sense. Right. Now here's another question. If you were fortifying here, what would you be shooting? I should probably shoot the, yeah. I'm just sitting around. Yeah. Yep. And this is the tricky thing because it's very easy to shoot Doomfist, but it might be a thing. It's in your face. And it's purple. And it's purple, right? But as soon as you see power block, you go no. And then you look at the aggression from somebody else who's literally right in front of your face, this is much more valuable. I mean, remember your job as tank is like to pressure the enemy team to control them, either to create space or deny them from taking space in your team. If this honsers allowed to play here, maybe he gets a headshot. If even if you don't get the kill, you force him back. You created and defended your team. This is just, and then now, obviously, even at full HP, you're at a major major risk right now. I've done it. Yeah. Or having to back up at a really crucial time when really you should have been like, okay, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, 4 to 5, not only am I doing more damage because I'm shooting in 4 to 5, but now I have my challenge been so I can stay here and then spin a fight into. Yeah. Right. Now like this is there's a 4 to 5. Like there's an anvil, right? That was it. That was a old, my tank is getting sandblasted. Yeah. I feel like this whole fight. I haven't had a really clear, like direction almost. Sure. I need to, like I'm chaotic. I'm constantly switching between targets and I'm just like on the payload and like that's my like, right single mogi brand thought. And I'm not really thinking about like anything else. All you do is you play some sort of cover. You shoot what's available. What's the most pressureable target whether it's a squishy that's close or a tank that's close. And then then you cycle your cooldowns to try and buy as much pressure as you possibly can as much pressure. And then obviously doing it around where your team is positioned and your team is here. So this is fine. Your nano'd right now what should you do? Shoot a squishy probably. Now your weapons about the overheat and I already used four to five. So I should try and I guess I could try and hit a spear. Okay. What's the problem of hitting a spear right now? He's probably just going to fly off the edge and go away from me. Right. So anyone who wants them close. So what I might do here, well you tell me what's the, what's cycling or cool on us right now? This is hard, right? This is what gives a risk of the, the complexity is like being able to juggle obviously. So you tell me, maybe I can say what do you do? I think I spin. Okay. Now before you spin, you've got a couple bullets left before you overheat. Right. Yeah. Okay. So a couple bullets you spin in on who? Fanzo. Okay. Then maybe maybe mercy to my right but it's just fly away probably. So yeah. Fanzo is accessible. Okay. So you shoot spin on Hanzo then what? If I have the spear and a wall at that point like if I can get him into that, whatever the round thing is like I could spear him and if not, um, probably just shoot. But I think my ideal thing here would be spin spear him into the statue. I don't know what you call that. Yeah. Sure. And then then shoot because by that time, I'll have like probably a third he and I'll be able to do. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And you're talking about going hyper hyper hyper aggressive. Why is that going to work? And you're using one of your cool ones to push instead of using it for like defense. Because I'm nanoed there. I don't know where they're on it is but their mercy is just chilling back there. Everybody's going to look at me and then the deems can be by himself. Right. So look at your bottom right. You're going to use your jab and spin in your nano right now. What's going to happen by the time the nano expires? Oh, for to find. You'll have four to five or you'll be very close to four to five. You always do be thinking one step ahead. Okay. So let's slow this down. Yeah. Are you stopped? Yeah. Just a little bit. But you should have been thinking in the back of my brain. I have nano or four to five. Excuse me. I have nano and four to five. I can go more aggressive and then by the time the four to five is expired. What are you going to have back again? The other two cool ones. Yeah. The other two cool ones. You're going to have spinning out. Yeah. The ones that just leaped. I didn't. I wasn't thinking about that. Yeah. And obviously there's two. One sleeping thing. I get one. I mean, I just fair enough. Spend. Yeah. Cover. Probably four to five. I think are a little low for this. Yeah. You need to be more aware of our HP. And he hack the image. You know this obviously. But even your ultimate is used about like chaining your survival ability. Right. One and the other and the other and the other and the other. Right. Get free from that. Now is that a good use of your spin. What you just did? I'm actually going to say yes because I was thinking he was going to just dash into my back line. Sure. And it's easier for me to just loop him off there and then deal with them in a second. Sure. Sometimes if this place somebody, it's worth it. But you have to ask yourself every time you do it. Was that displacement reasonable? Or is it just me pressing a cool one because it's a ticky ticky ticky. You know, like we're in a point now where like just using cool ones from the sake of using cool ones. It's not makes sense. Now I will say that this makes sense. You know, okay. I think we also caught damage or it was well. So that's cool. But. Oh. Oh. Oh. I see. Yeah. I think that spear is kind of dumb to cue because even if I did spear the mercy, I almost certainly was not going to kill here. Right. And then I don't have spear. The. Okay. Does his spear need to get kill or have a chance of getting a kill for it to be valuable? No because the mercy is going to freak out. Right. So the question was is is it good pressure? Not as a good. Always. There chance of getting a kill. So like right now, if I land this javan. I pin her maybe the enemy team kind of freaks and she's delayed. Not the worst spear was what? That way. Yeah. I think might have spear now. Yeah. There's three of them right there. Right. That's the. That's if there is a problem. It was how low of a percentage chance the spear was going to hit in comparison to what was going to happen literally two seconds later where this spear chances were infinitely higher. It was not that. Oh, the mercy wasn't likely to die. It was the fact that it was very hard to hit and there's an easier spear immediately available here. That's my problem. Or to find. You think about it. You think about it. Like I. Oh. I was not expecting to get killed there either. I mean, it's okay. It's CC it pulls a man. It's good damage, right? 100 to 100 damage or whatever. It's only one hole. Hey, this is this is your site. This is your site college showing up front center full color. Yeah, you know, I know it's hard, but even if you miss half of your shots, this is going to matter more. Mm-hmm. Right. You're so obsessed. And then I wake up this. I think you're in the almost kills my support. And then there in your Genji, you're going to pop off. For the final. Before we lose your armor. Yeah. That's a spirit needs to hit. No, don't just spin. Don't just spin. Yeah, see. Don't just spin. Yeah, see. Don't just spin. That's what it's like. Like, oh, I hit a spear. Like, oh, I saved my save my own life. Like, right, better hit the other cooldown. Right. Right. Right. Just shoot the Reaper and then fortify and look at the Reaper now and just buy time. Right. Now the other thing with the wrist as well, it's like you got to think like a Reinhardt, too. Like, you're not going to have a lot of mobility with where you can position, but I'm thinking, can you go out top here and then drop from high ground there, right? Just to make sure the Doomfist isn't up here. Clear this thing. Clear this thing. Clear this space before you have to go stop car before we have to go front lane. And even when you're rolling out, should you roll out here or should you roll out here? Yeah. You see the difference? One clears this high ground. One goes straight to cart. Both of them will end up fighting on main and that's a lot of whatever it says will do, but you're taking the opportunity at least clear and holding, make sure that there's nobody on high ground. Because unless they're on like a Reinhardt or something like that, nobody can be the risotto to toe one. Nope. So if there's anybody here, they will have to leave and that helps your team up. Right. Yeah. There you go. There you go. And versus this composition as well, you notice something like, look at their composition, right? What do they lack compared to what they had earlier? A range? Right. So then how can you what kind of utility can you utilize here? I mean, you're doing it right now. Right. Right. You can just go, you can just shoot people. Right. Now you can still have brawl with them, but you can force cool downs and do damage just by using your mouse wants. Sitting there in the back. Yeah. They're running, they swapped it. Mercy elucid at a touch too. Yeah. So it's a big mouse. Big mouse. Yeah. They're a big, they're kind of running on fumes. Right. And we haven't swapped anything. So who should you shoot right now? Is there real questions? Oh, this is Genji coming around on my left? It's tricky, isn't it? See, this, this is, this is the thing. Is it Doomfist? Is it Reaper? Is it Genji? Honestly, I don't care. I think all of them are reasonable targets. Right. But like, let's say this Genji was on cart. Definitely do this. Let's say this Doomfist was on cart. Definitely Genji. Right. You kind of vary depending on who you shoot, depending on how aggressively they are. And obviously, ADPS is generally better than a tank, but what the tank is playing more front line, right? And that Doomfist like definitely wants to go behind me like to the right. Here it is again. So you get slammed. Before to fight. Okay. We jab him. The spin we still have a full second and a half on our hold on. You know, we don't need a jab. Okay. So what do you sing so far? What needs to be improved? I'm just spinning for no reason. Yeah. My jab ones aren't terrible. But I just like to blast all my cooldowns. I would say this for this way. I think your target priority with jab one isn't terrible. You're trying to go for school shoes when they get a little bit too aggressively. The thing is, you can jab one tanks all the live long day, but yeah, are you going to get enough HP off of that jab and to make it valuable? Sometimes, yes, sometimes, no. Especially if there's something like a right heart or like an arise with four 58 just isn't worth it usually. So usually you need to go for the more lower percentage, but if you hit it, it's a lot more. So jab ones mechanics a little bit. The big one like you said is just spinning for no real reason, especially when you're already fortified. It's like frustrating what else? Yeah. My positioning isn't fantastic. I think it's like, you know, you just knowing, okay, I have four to five have jab. I can play this position. I don't have this cooldowns. I cannot play this position. Yeah. You know, that's something that's like everything over the risk of coming back to cool because the cooldowns themselves affect how you position you. That's a good jab, force it back. Now, kind of going back to what we started with, right? You want to, you know, some people impute some people, right? You can shoot Hanzo, but you got to be careful, right? At some point, this cop, we're going to need to try to get on top or closer to that Hanzo in soldier or take angles, or in shoot Doomfist, where the Hanzo soldier can't see us, right? Because even though we're probably the second pokey is tanking the game, we're the third pokey tanking the game, we just don't win the straight. Yeah, we just don't. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And you're thinking about it. Fine. He's pocketed, low. And you got, you got, you got everything else on, right? So, so think of it like a Winston, right? Think of it like you're slowly staging and taking space walking forward. Where do you go next? In the next, like say 10 seconds, where would you go? I think I should probably, I think I would probably swing to stairs. Hmm. Yes. Why? Because they're all chilling on the hangar and then I have a really good angle on that Hanzo. Yeah. Close some cover. Like, yes, the Hanzo can shoot you, but only the Hanzo can shoot you. Yeah. Right. And you're at a closer range, dude. So then what do you do from here? Next step. Step one. Step two. Spam the Hanzo a bit. Probably see what he does and then swing to the actual high ground. Yep. And then from here. Because they're running. Yeah. They're running a soldier. Right. Right. So you're closing the distance. Then from here we go from here and then from here we go to like, you know, here and then from here we go. Yeah. And then from here we go to here and then from here we go to you know, and so on, right? But like, that's kind of like our mindset. Right. Now, what if they run a comp like, let's say Reaper Tracer? Like a Moira Winston, something like that. Someone with a, like, like, we saw it earlier, right? The Doomfist and the Reaper. How would you position here? So like, when in Reaper Tracer, something like that. Just like, let's just say what they were playing on the attack on third point. Right. So I've probably played this corner a little this corner by the right stairs earlier. Right. The other. We're here. This is a little more spam. Yeah. Because then my supports have like some protection and I can just leave if I need to. Sure. But lots of shooting. Right. Lots of shooting. Yeah. Okay. But you can't be here. You know, this is the thing. It's like you just just standing in the open. They're all looking at me. They have a better position. Because obviously, you don't die for it. You don't even get shot that much. But that if that's even a slightly better team, you have to use Japanese spin. Yeah. Just to move there when I want you to be able to walk here without using any cool nons. I don't. Yeah. Where if I? I think I'm fortifying in this game too as like a reaction to getting CC by the new fist and I'm doing it so late. Like I'm not. You're already losing a little bit of a team by the time. You know, and like this is just a disaster. It's like as soon as you see, you know, here, I know they're low. But you're low when you don't even know it. Yeah. You know, I'm saying you look at your cool vans. You you you're in trouble. Yeah. I mean, honestly, like here's the funny thing is you're a tank at all. But if you don't have javlin spin or fortify, you lose a one day one to haunt so most of the time. Brad, a vehicle skill. He stormy hours he hits you and head you're done. That's the funny thing. Everything is great until you don't have a cool one. So you're just a big toast. No. It just doesn't do anything. This is a cool down for nothing. Yeah. Oh, no. He was like the javlin, right? Like why javlin even? You know, and then now you're fortify your javlin and your spin or down? Yeah. I think when I was, I think what I was thinking of and I think what I was thinking of was like, if I get a little cheeky, I could pull off an old, but then I realize as soon as I press E, I'm like, nope, that's dumb. And then I back up. But I think it's the problem, not lies not in that, but in just pressing E to begin. Right. Right. It's like, it's like you're trying to like stuff them in the choke, you know, but like honestly, yeah, that's not good because if you look at it, like who can see them in the choke right now? Yeah. No. Just to you. And I'm running like, oh, right. We want them to like come to like here, then we use our cool dots where we can actually shoot them. So you're down everything into what this means. Is it now you have a moment fragility and it's at the most important part point to five? You need to be, if anything now is when you need to be playing aggressively and you're not.
